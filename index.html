              <div class="summary">After a year off, Good Times with Mo: The Podcast is back! The country's longest running and most successful mainstream podcast makes its much awaited return with Episode 1 of Season 6. It's the same format with Mo taking calls from all around the world and answering questions about love, life, and sex. Heres the episode breakdown:</div>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Timmy, a 23 year old from Quezon City who thinks she might be addicted to buying sex toys. That's just the tip of the iceberg though! She expounds on what has been a wild ride since she graduated from college that gets even crazier now that she's in her early 20's.</li><li>Caller #2 is Mimi, 28 year old from Los Angeles who is contemplating divorce from her husband who isn't into sex. With her bedroom life in a miserable state, she's feeling a bit guilty that she's entertaining the thought of leaving him over this reason since he is a really good guy.</li><li>Caller #3 is 33 year old Gretchen from New York City. Gretchen broke up with her boyfriend last week because her ex has come back into the scene, but he only wants her for sex. She likes his sexual energy but he doesn't want to commit to her any longer. That, and he has a girlfriend. Good Times.</li><li>Caller #4 is Celebrity Hunk Derek Ramsey, 41 years old from Manila. Derek and Mo have a long heart to heart conversation about the pressures he faces within his relationship and whether he would think about quitting showbiz in order to settle down with his girlfriend. There's some slight turmoil going on in House Ramsey and let's see how Derek approaches it.</li>

Some interesting questions lead to topics that will leave you chatting about it amongst your friends -- from catfishing, to incompatible sex lives, and Born-Again Christian blowjobs! Geezus. Let's get to it!</div>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is 30yr old Christine from Manila who has been catfishing a guy she met online for nearly 2 years. The guy has sent her a pair of some sought after shoes and she's feeling guilty and wants to come clean. What are the chances he forgives her?</li><li>Caller #2 is Ninyo, a 37 year old from a small enclaved country in Africa called Lesotho. After Mo geeks out about Lesotho for the first 10 mins of the call, things get really fun! Ninyo is a bigger than life personality with a self-proclaimed amazing butt! While he found out his fuck buddy is married, he's really more upset that his FUBU doesn't like his pictures on Instagram. Priorities, man.</li><li>Caller #3 is Camille who is 28 years old from Q.C. -- Camille has green eyes, which immediately makes her a 10. Cam also has only had one boyfriend her whole adult life and she is thinking of maybe breaking off the relationship to feel what it is like to be single for one day, or more. She gets pretty emotional on the call and you can't help but root for her. It must be the eyes!</li><li>Caller #4 is Marie who is 30 years old from Baltimore, Maryland. Marie feels like her new born-again Christian boyfriend might be rushing things a bit between them so they can get married ASAP and they can finally start having sex. "Not a bad plan!" - sabi ni Lerd.</li>

Will we go down as the greatest podcast ever aired? Or will we suffer a Starkanian death at some point? Time shall tell but let's start the month with a bang! Here are the episode deets:</div>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 caller is actress Jasmine Curtis Smith, 24 years old from Melbourne, Australia. Jasmine calls in to talk about the challenges of finding time to balance a busy showbiz career and a serious boyfriend. At 24, Jasmine wants to capitalize on her prime earning years in the biz but her live-in(!) boyfriend would like more of her. What does she prioritize? Let's find out.</li><li>Caller #2 caller is Mark, 40 years old from Texas, USA. Mark is getting married and he wants to know if he should erase ALL the sextapes and nude pics he has of his exes now that it's time to settle down. If he says yes, that's going to be the slowest delete button in keyboard history!</li><li>Caller #3 caller is Boyet 26yrs from Dubai, UAE. Boyet is dating a girl who has had cheated a few times in past relationships. It has him (as the kids say it) shookt! LOL. He wants to know if there's any truth to the saying, "Once a cheater, always a cheater." Do people have infidelity in their DNA? What do you guys think?</li><li>Caller #4 caller is Dee 28yrs from Laguna, PH. Dee just got back from the UAE where she was arrested! Hot damn! Dee breaks down what life in a Dubai female prison is like and how she is coping with her return to the PH after being deported.</li>

              <div class="summary">Hey Hey Hey! It's the weekend! A perfect time to catch up on GTWM Podcast episodes and we have a fresh one today and another one tomorrow for your downloading pleasure. The show starts off with Mo announcing a career decision that's been 20 years in the making, but nothing that should affect the radio or podcast -- so no worries there. Let's get with the calls though:</div>
              
                <div class="callers">

                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 Caller is a podcast darling for the past 4 years, many of you know her as Swinger Hannah, now 28 years old from Manila. Hannah is still about dat lyf, as this time she's dating a drug dealer. Yes, DEALER! She wants to know if she should continue to pursue this guy or perhaps move on to something more exciting like a serial killer. Haaay, Hannah.</li><li>Caller #2 caller is 40 year old Oswald from Los Angeles, USA. Oswald has had a busy past when it comes to women -- usually carrying 6-8 girlfriends at a time, many of them married. That experience has left Oswald a bit scarred since he has lost faith in honest and loyal relationships. He says he now has the perfect girlfriend but since he doesn't trust people, he wonders if perfect, or even just good, really exists.</li><li>Caller #3 caller is Bobby, 50yrs old from Manila. Bobby runs a popular blog that deals with high-end escorts, massage parlors, and spakols. He educates Mo (who is very anti-prostitution) about the differences between the establishments and how the "hobby" in the Philippines is thriving and as popular as ever.</li><li>Caller #4 caller is Nikka, 28yrs old from Taguig. For the nth time this early season, we have another person who is sexually frustrated about their partner. Most often, it is a female calling about what to do with their "good, kind hearted man" who doesn't like sex that much. What is in the water that these men are drinking?! Raise your hand gentlemen if you'd like a girlfriend or wife that wants to have sex as much as you do. Great, I still see hands.</li>

              <div class="summary">Closing out week 2 of this seasons GTWMPodcast, we have a meaty episode! Mo's wife Angelicopter shows up for half the episode and anytime you get a husband and wife talking about roles in a marriage, you can expect things to get heated and hotter than April summers in Davao. We need to remind everyone that at the end of each Podcast month, Mo will post a poll on social media and you guys can vote who was your favorite caller of the month! That caller will receive an awesome new TV from Sharp Philippines! Now let's get to the drama!</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Jonas, 37, from Cavite. Jonas is in some shit. His wife cheated on him 4 years ago when she was working in Dubai. She decided to leave her husband and 3 kids for the "new guy." Well, they didn't work out and mega brokenhearted wife, who has no money and no job, wanted to move back into Jonas' home. They agreed they will no longer pursue their marriage but Jonas now has the burden of having to support his unemployable wife, along with her smoking and drinking habit, while trying to move on from the drama so he can be a single guy. Before you guys say 'FML' when it comes to your relationship, remember Jonas' situation. LOL.</li><li>Caller #2 is Ritch from Laguna. Ritch is 29yrs old and working in the banking industry. Ritch is a Hugot Queen. She's one of those that likes to post bikini shots on socmed and attaches hugot lines with the pic. Ritch has a manager at her bank who has a husband. Husband is now messaging hugot shit to Ritch everyday. Ritch doesn't know what to do. The moral of the story? Don't hugot when posting hubad on IG for some likes, you're gonna regret it.</li><li>Caller #3 is 27 year old Nikki from Virginia, USA. Nikki is 3 months pregnant and wants to ask if she and her husband should move back into her parents home so they can help her with the kids. There are different schools of thought in a scenario like this. Are you, A) Team Yours Kids Your Problem Not Your Parents Problem or are you B) Team Lola Can Also Be Yaya For Free? Mo and Chopper give their thoughts.</li><li>Caller #4 is Franco who is 28 from Makati. Franco feels emasculated by his new girlfriend. The fault predominantly falls on his shoulders as Franco has the inability to assert himself into the relationship. And now, its affecting his dick. Remember, problems of the heart and the mind often becomes a problem with your balls. Science.</li>

              <div class="summary">It's Monday, funday! #SaidNoOneEverBut hey, at least we have a new GTWM Podcast episode for you! Before I give you the details, let's us ask for your patience. Some people have reached out and said that the audio of the callers tend to be a little low. We know. Sorry about that. Many of these calls that are airing were recorded some time back and Mo was using two computers at the time and each unit had different settings, one for calls and one for Mo -- they didn't sync up so the sound was a bit compromised. Pasensya na, tao lang po. Wala namang perpektong tao kundi si Lerd. LOL It should get better soon once the remaining calls from that time airs. That's the bad news, now here's the worse news: people's life problems. Let's get to it.</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Mary, 37 years old from Q.C. I warned you, it gets worse. One of the tougher GTWM calls to take in this early season, Mary is a return caller from Season 5. 2 years ago she called saying she caught her pre-teen son molesting his little sister. Cut to present day, she caught him doing it again. I'm not sure there are words that anyone can say to help out in a situation like this but perhaps there's some solutions to be had. Told you. It's fucking miserable.</li><li>Caller #2 is 37 year old actress Kaye Abad calling in from Cebu! 3 years married with a baby, Kaye opens up to Mo about the challenges in her marriage and what her pet peeves are about her husband, actor Paul Jake Castillo. If you think you are a patient, trusting wife -- be prepared to meet the Queen Bee of trust.</li><li>Caller #3 is Lara from Atlanta, USA. Lara, 23yrs old, met her current boyfriend on Tinder while she had another boyfriend at the time. Current boyfriend was also on Tinder while he had a girlfriend. While they were dating, they both too were seeing and living with other people. Boyfriend even got another girl pregnant. Now, they have some trust issues. Who would have thunk, right? If you like math and riddles, this is the call for you. There's a lot of variables going on.</li><li>Caller #4 is M.A. a 30 year old from Taguig. M.A. is a fairly well known YouTuber with a 30k following on Twitter. On occasion he'd use that popularity to get some ass, because of course he should. Well, he banged a guy that his friend likes. That's a clear and present Bro Code violation. However, M.A. is gay so the question needs to be asked, "Is there a bro code within the gay culture?" What do you think?</li>

I'm quite certain you read about President Duterte bragging about his dick size. Well, that's all I got for "small" talk.

                    <li>Caller #1 is 24yr old Mia from Makati. Mia had a wild weekend with a foreigner on a Philippine beach destination (tell me if you've ever heard this story before.) She's tried to date to him after that but LDR issues became trust issues became wala na. She's got a new foreigner boyfriend but she can't seem to get the first guy off her mind. He lives in the PH, runs a scuba diving company near the beach and she wants to go back, bad. Export quality si girl!</li><li>Caller #2 is Vince, 27yrs old from Mindanao. Vince is in a relationship with his cousin. They have a one year old child together and while Vince doesn't owe anyone an explanation or an apology about how he lives his life, he would like Mo and Chopper's take on his situation. Is it morally wrong to be in a relationship with a cousin? Yes, you say? Well, what if your cousin looks like Solenn? Yeah, that's what I thought. You hypocrites. LOL.</li><li>Caller #3 is Marie from QC, who is 28 years old and 8 months pregnant! Marie thinks her husband needs to have sex soon. They stopped having sex a month ago and she's worried that after birth she'll need 3 months to recover, but how will her hubby survive that long? Forget the pregnant wife and the new born miracle in their lives, THE MAN NEED TO EJACULATE!</li><li>Caller #4 is 28 year old Paul from Pampanga. Paul has been married for 3 years, no kids, and he kinda hates his wife. He wants to leave but she doesn't want the marriage to end, and to make matters worse, Paul's family is really upset at him because HE is unhappy. Sucks to be you, Paul.</li>

Single now for 4 years, Byron is at that point in his life wherein he wants a fruitful relationship but he's worried that all his online fuccboi activity has made him forget how to have a legit date.

Jen too has been a Tinder regular and recently ended a fuck buddy relationship and she's starting to miss the regular sexual partner in her life. An old friend from 10 years back has been messaging her and he wants some of dat ass. Jen wants to know if she should give in to his sexual advances because there's no one else showing interest.</li><li>Caller #3 is Carmela from Newcastle, Australia. 36 year old Carmela met a guy on Tinder and had sex with him the first time they got together in person. He's a backpacking Aussie filmmaker that started showing up for more regular sex, even spending the night a few times per week. When she told him she was leaving for a abrupt Philippine vacation, si boy nagbook ng flight din! Was it starting to get serious? Well, things started to break down one in Siquijor when the guy left her at the bar so he can have sex with another girl he just met. Since then, Carmela has been distant and sex just isn't as good anymore.</li><li>Caller #4 is Milagros, 33yrs old from Manila. Milagros met her first and only boyfriend on Tinder. Wow.

              <div class="summary">Fresh from an amazing weekend, we have a new GTWM Podcast episode. Damn, wasn't that a great GoT start of the season?! I loved it! This podcast isn't a GoT fan theory show, but just like the Thrones, we are full of strong female characters in this all-female caller cast. So lets get to their details now!</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is our first return caller of the season, and she seems to be the most memorable one of the first 10 episodes. I'm talking about Timmy, 23yr old from Q.C. She was the first caller of Season 6 but this time she wants to ask Mo about a her fuck buddy that got mad when she recently had a threesome. Fubu didnt want an exclusive relationship so why is he bent about her recent threesome? Sounds a bit unfair.</li><li>Caller #2 is 25 year old Michelle from Chicago, USA. Michelle has a bunch of question for Mo, all stemming from current issues shes going through as a young, semi-single Filipina in America. Instead of tackling one issue, Mo treats this call as a rapid-fire lighting round wherein he gives short bursts of advice to the many inquiries Michelle has.</li><li>Caller #3 is 31 year old Maymay from Las Vegas, USA. May met a girl on Tinder a year and a half ago. The girl is married but they are still seeing each other. It's also an LDR thing. Yikes, LDR and Caller #3 party? Where's the win in all this?</li><li>Caller #4 is our celebrity caller of the week! And it's 37 year old Liza Dino-Seguerra from Manila. Liza is an actress, beauty queen, the Chairperson of the Film Development Council of the Philippines, and wife of actor/singer Ice Seguerra. Liza calls in to discuss the pressures of trying to have a baby now as her husband Ice, a transgender man, is going through the motions of getting his eggs ready for harvest -- Liza is finding it hard to dedicate the time she needs while juggling her administration appointed role. Should she get pregnant or later on "Pag Dating Ng Panahon." as Ice once wrote. Liza and Mo also discuss how open they might be to raising a "genderless child." It's an interesting call, definitely worth your time.</li>

              <div class="summary">Happy Easter boys and girls! How was your Holy week? Did you spend it in serenity and prayer, reflecting on the Risen Lord? Or were you at parties nearing alcohol blood poisoning waking up next to a stranger or fuck bunny? Either way, you need a break and a new GTWM episode is the right way to go about it. The Villanelle look-a-like Angelicopter joins the entire episode which makes for great conversation and a slightly longer running time than usual. Here are the calls:</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is 34 yr old Gee from Las Vegas, USA. Gee's fiancé died tragically 6 months ago and his guy best friend has been affected the most. He contacts Gee regularly and is so broken by the loss of his friend that he has a hard time functioning every day. Gee has been the stable rock in the other people's lives as they deal with the death. The problem is no one is there for Gee. No one is comforting her loss and she has been busy comforting everyone else. Is it selfish to ask, 'What about me?" "How come no one is asking if I'm okay" -- Gee would like some love and attention too, and she deserves it.</li><li>Caller #2 is Phoebe from Angeles, Pampanga. Phoebe is 26yrs old and she met a guy on Tinder who lives in Iloilo. Dude is 41 years old and married but in the process of an annulment. He is also a pilot so the usual LDR problems that people face, he gets to hop on a plane and fix stuff like that. But like the majority of guys on Tinder, he's not really there looking for labels. A 41 year old pilot is looking for 26 yr old ass in different area codes (er, provinces) Hulaan mo, na in-love si Phoebe, no? Prolly.</li><li>Caller #3 is Rasj who is 35yrs old from Singapore. Rasj has been in Singapore for 10 years now and she wants to know if she should take a job offer in Australia. There's always risk is uprooting the family to go to a different country, but which opportunities should people go after and which ones should they decline? Australia is tempting! Great weather. Awesome benefits. Beaches! Good pay. And the best of all, Australia is home to a HUGE variety of the world's most venomous and treacherous snakes, spiders, box jelly fish, even a Cassowary which is a beautiful bird that can tear a human into lego sized pieces. Advance Australia fair!</li><li>Caller #4 is 36 yr old Gina from London, England. Gina and her husband both have 18yr old daughters from previous relationships but Gina has raised her "stepdaughter" for the majority of the child's life so she considers herself as the mother figure to the girl, rightfully so. However, in a recent argument, Gina's husband said the ugly line of "not meddling in his daughters affairs" when a problem came up. Gina was hurt by the line and calls in to ask Mo and Chopper (who have a slightly similar setup) what are her boundaries in being a stepmom. This is the longest call of the season, at 40mins, that means it's a good conversation. Don't miss it.</li>

              <div class="summary">Before we get to anything podcast related, I'd just like to say I hope everyone in the Philippines is safe and without major structural damage to your homes and businesses after the earthquake that struck Luzon a few hours ago. Always be prepared. Fresh from Easter Sunday and another Game of Thrones episode, Mo starts the show with his thoughts on E02 of GoT S8 minus having to perv over the Arya Stark sex scene. Yes, there was generous side boob action there but c'mon GoT creators, we could have done without that! That's Arya, she's still 12 years old in our eyes. Yes, we are proud of the go-getter attitude of this young adult but Arya?! I would have rather seen the dire wolves mounting each other and banging one out. Okay, let's get to some adult conversation.</div>

                    <li>Caller #1 is Daniel who is 23yrs old from Cebu. Danny boy gets boners. Lots of them! He is particularly nervous about an upcoming medical exam wherein he is 100% certain that he'll get a boner regardless of whether the doctor is male or female. He wants to know how to handle this awkward situation. Listen, boners should be embraced but they can also bite you in the ass. Lotta pun there.</li><li>Caller #2 is Naomi, 31yrs old from Singapore. Naomi recently found a private message thread on FB Messenger that has her best friend talking shit about her and calling her a social climber -- all that good stuff. To add, Naomi even recently agreed to be the maid of honor at BFF's wedding! That snake! She wants to know if she should confront her BFF about what she read, but since they also work together, she's a bit unsure if she should bring that drama into the equation. Take the high road or kick her to the curb? What do you think?</li><li>Caller #3 is Pacho from Los Angeles, USA. Pacho wants tips on how to have more sex with his wife considering they have a nosy toddler who is constantly monitoring the house for them. Sure, you can bang in front of your 3 year old Golden Retriever, but do you have the guts to sneak in sex with a 3 year old boy lurking around the apartment? He's 3, he doesn't know anything, right? Right?!</li><li>Caller #4 is a 49 year old Philippine Senator named JV Ejercito. JV is on the campaign trail trying to get re-elected as a senator. JV and his crook brother, Jinggoy, who is also running for a senate seat, don't have the best relationship. JV opens up about their sibling rivalry and Mo asks the hypotheical question of, "If I were to vote for one Ejercio Estrada in this election, why would I pick you?" According to JV's campaign slogan, hes "the good one." LOL.</li>

We have a pretty entertaining lineup of calls today and we can't wait for you to relate! That could be a good tagline for the podcast, right? "We can't wait for you to relate." Pwede. I don't know if the show has ever had a tagline, perhaps we should think about that. If you have a suggestion, please fire away. Now let's get hot and heavy with the call log:</div>

                    <li>Caller #1 is 23 year old Cielo from Manila. Cielo is a UP Diliman grad in Philosophy and she wants to know the answer to the million peso question: "How do you know when a fuccboi is really changing for the serious?" This is up there with the search for the fountain of youth or gold at the end of a rainbow. My question is, when the hell are we going to change the spelling of fuccboi? It's so stupid.</li><li>Caller #2 is Miles from far away L.A., California. Miles is 24yrs old and currently got his 22yr old girlfriend pregnant. But 2 weeks ago, he cheated on her with one of his good friend's girlfriend. It was a two hit combo revenge plan that you should listen to so you can understand it more. Miles came to the USA from PH at 18 without any money and was able to power through and get a good job in Hollywood. But at 24, is he ready to be a better boyfriend and father? Again, 'How do you know when a fuccboi is changing for the serious?' LOL.</li><li>Caller #3 is M.A., 30yrs, from Manila. M.A. got into a social media war with a bunch of religious people regarding yesterdays earthquake. Social media wars are about 95% stupid, but Mo, being a huge fan of them, tells M.A. about the expectations of online disagreements and whether or not they are worth getting in to. Them keyboard warriors are drinking Haterade!</li><li>Caller #4 is Elle, also from Manila, and 28 years old. Laki ng problema ni Elle. She feels like her boyfriend's family doesn't like her as they don't allow him to travel with her and they don't get her any gifts for Xmas. Have you ever been in one of these? I used to be the guy that all parents loved until I started this damn podcast and since then it's been a parental curse!</li>

Okay fine, back from the ends of the universe, comedian Alex Calleja makes his much anticipated return as our famous caller for E15! Yup, the idol himself is back and because he's such a talker, Mo is only able to squeeze in 3 calls for the show. And here they are:</div>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is 37yr old Louie from Laguna. Louie is going through a rough patch right now as he just found out on Facebook that his father has a child from a different woman. Louie has always known his father to be babero but this is just the icing on top of the shittiest tasting cake ever baked. Louie gets very emotional here but he can serve as a very inspiring story for those with similar challenges. Don't miss this call.</li><li>Caller #2 is Frances who is 29 from Texas, USA. Frances has been in an LDR for 2 years now with her boyfriend in Germany. She is currently taking her doctorate and she is trying to get tips on how to convince her boyfriend to move to the US. He wants her to move to Germany. Unfortunately, her doctorate and career will only net her about 1/4 of the salary she currently gets in the US. Her boyfriend LOVES Germany and it's going to take more than a financial reason to pack things up and move to America. There's some tug of war here and lets see who prevails.</li><li>Caller #3 is actor/comedian Alex Calleja. Alex was a mainstay on Season 5 of GTWM Podcast and his long awaited return happens today, but as a caller. Alex has had a colorful marriage and he brings up an issue that many a couple may endure -- seenzone messages. Alex's wife doesn't like it when she texts him and doesn't get a response. If you have his track record, I can't blame her! LOL. Some solutions are thrown around on how to get through this issue. Alex then opens up about the alarming amount of mainland Chinese that have infiltrated the Philippines of late. A lot of people have been bringing this up on social media and he wanted to give his take. How do you feel about the Chinese subtitles in movies? It's a delicate issue but definitely a conversation many of you are having.</li>

                    <li>Caller #1 is Felicia who is 31yrs old from Singapore. She discovered the guy she is seeing might be married. It bothers her because she thought the arrangement she has with him is exclusive; however, she is dating a few other people on the side as well. The girl can't have her cake and eat it too! Also, Felicia is a dominatrix which adds a nice little twist.</li><li>Caller #2 is Ace from Vancouver, Canada. Ace is 23yrs old and is a member of the LGBTQ community but her best friend who recently broke up with her boyfriend is claiming her ex is gay -- hence the breakup. It's getting to a point wherein her anti-gay rhetoric is a bit offensive to Ace, and she needs to clean that shit up.</li><li>Caller #3 is Kim who is 36yrs old from Toronto, Canada. Kim has had a fuck buddy for 4 years now. They have done a lot of the couple stuff like travel, meetup with the family, etc. But as with many FWB setups, long term clarity is the issue. This is a common problem with many callers/listeners and while every situation is unique, you can always learn a bit more about your casual relationship by listening to the challenges of others like you.</li><li>Caller #4 is 48 year old journalist Karen Davila, from Manila. Karen is a standout journalist/newscaster in the Philippines and immense popularity brings a steady stream of bashers online. Karen calls in to pick Mo's brain on how he handles online trolls and haters. We learn a bit more about Karen and her upbringing in this very interesting spotlight call.</li>

I think I have the cure, a brand new episode of GTWM: The Podcast! This episode is full of really good calls that I think you're going to enjoy. Mo starts the episode with a topic from the Magic morning show this week. He is asking listeners if they can name ONE fashionable fat guy. Just one. Mo believes that fat men are not capable of looking good in clothing. It's true. Can you think of one? While you marinate on that, let's check out the calls:</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Arya from Niagara Falls, Canada. Arya's friend, who recently moved to Canada from the Philippines, just got fired from her job -- for MASTURBATING at work!! Eh di hell yeah. She was double clicking her own mouse when her employer could hear her moaning in the room having a video sex chat. Arya wants to know if she should tell her friend the reason for her termination.</li><li>Caller #2 is Jonel who is 38yrs old from Dubai. Jonel lives in a one bedroom apartment with his wife and 3 kids -- two of them are teenagers. One afternoon while the kids were on the TV, Jonel and his wife decided to sneak into the bedroom for some hair-pulling hardcore doggystyle. The problem? They forgot to lock the door. Teens walked in. Scarred for life?</li><li>Caller #3 is 38 year old Thomas from New Mexico, USA. Thomas lives in a very remote part of an already remote state. He's longing for a social life, hasn't had sex in years and he has never been in a relationship in his life! He wants to know if he should relocate to a bigger, livelier city even though he has a good paying job. When you live in a city where boredom is the second leading cause of death for people 35 and below, yes, get the fuck out.</li><li>Caller #4 is Victor from Mandaluyong. Victor broke up with his girlfriend in January but he is having difficulty moving on. He is currently banging 3 girls and he is making it a point to post on IG that his life is great but there's still something missing. He constantly checks if his ex has viewed his IG stories and if she hasn't, he feels bad about it. He needs some help to get out of this rut.</li>

              <div class="summary">It's election week in the Philippines! Who do you have on your #MondayList? Mo starts off the episode by giving his list for senatorial bets, and why not make it a point to go out and vote (right) while listening to the podcast as you're standing in line ready to NOT elect a bunch of criminals or idiots? I know going out to vote can be a hassle for people who don't like being outside and oily in this kind of heat, but please do it. I beg you. It's important! Now let's get to the calls.</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Joyce who is 24 years old from Pampanga. Joyce wants to ask Mo if she should tell her new boyfriend about all the guys she's had sex with. It's not an absurd number but it is ALWAYS a bad idea to open about your sex number. Seldom would you find a guy who is okay with any number higher than 0.</li><li>Caller #2 is Maine, 25 from Cebu. Maine was honest with her boyfriend about how many guys shes been in bed with -- she even gave some juicy details about a scandalous sexual affair. Of course, it came back to bite her in the ass. 2 weeks ago her boyfriend was a bit jealous about a few guys that were eyeing Maine at church and he proceeded to tell her that nadidiri sya sa kanya in reference to her sexual past. Ouch. See, I told you it's an awful idea to be honest.</li><li>Caller #3 is a long-time caller from New Zealand, 33yr old Merbs from New Plymouth. Merbs has been getting some death threats from his ex-girlfriend's family. Why? Well, they're accusing Merbs of passing on an STD to his ex, which resulted in her eventually getting cancer. The ex comes from a somewhat prominent political family so Merbs is concerned for the safety of his family in the Philippines. Fuck cancer. Don't fuck Merbs.</li><li>Caller #4 is Ray from Mandaluyong. 20 year old Ray reached out to Mo via Twitter today to tell him that he is bothered by the way Mo pronounces the names of certain characters on Game of Thrones. They end up talking extensively about Season 8. If you're not a GoT fan, you're gonna hate this call so fast forward this part and go back to your loser lives.</li>

              <div class="summary">Hey hey hey! It's episode 19 of this season of GTWM! We have a great episode here, full of PBA player chismis! Before we get to the details, Mo announces that he will likely post new episodes of GTWM on weekends moving forward. You still get the 3 eps per week, but having a regular release sked works well for the show -- so expect new episodes on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Did I say chismis? Oh yeah, let's get to it:</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Alia, 25yrs from Kuwait. Alia met a Serbian guy on Tinder and decided to have sex with him when they met. The problem? He's BIG. In all places. He ends up tearing her vagina so bad that she required stitches. The problem? Well, in many Middle Eastern countries, you can't just walk right in an ER and ask for medical care due to casual sex. That shit ain't allowed. So Alia and little Jokic had to run around the city looking for a hospital that would keep her secret before she bleeds out. What a story. It gets even better but I don't want to spoil any further.</li><li>Caller #2 is Jonas, 37yrs from Cavite. Jonas is a return caller and has a new dilemma at work. Two girls are showing heavy interest in him. One is a girl his age who is in a same sex relationship and the other is a 19 year old. Both girls have been engaging in heavy sexual flirtation and Jonas needs to ask Mo where to put his boner.</li><li>Caller #3 is Michael, 32yrs from Sydney, Australia. Michael has been married with his wife for 3yrs; however, they haven't had sex in over a year. Admittedly, most of the blame Michael puts on himself -- he is no longer sexually attracted to his wife. The reason being is that she got fat. It's a very unique situation because he is still in love with her and they have gotten to a point wherein anything that can/may lead to sex becomes awkward. Wife even bought him a fleshlight to see if he can get his sex drive back. This is a can't miss call.</li><li>Caller #4 is MJ who is 42yrs old from Saitama, Japan. MJ met a guy on Tinder and after a few months of chatting (but nothing on video), MJ decided to meet up with this guy. On their scheduled meet date, MJ went to the parlor to doll up and she swears she saw the guy there and he looks considerably older than in his photo -- let's all say it together, SHOCKING! She wasn't completely sure it was him but when it came time to see each other that day, boy didn't show up. She wants insight on what possibly happened.</li>

                    <li>Caller #1 is actress/chef/TV host Donita Rose! Donita is our celebrity caller of the week! At 44 years old, Donita opens up about her 10 year battle with weight problem. She recently found out that she has crossed the obesity line and she's been busting her ass to try to lose weight -- unfortunately, 10 years of dieting hasn't been a success. In her 20's Donita was one of the country's biggest stars and an international star in her own right. She was the cover of Time Magazine, a main face of MTV, and one of the more sought after endorsers. She asks Mo if after failing these past years with her diet, should she continue to try to lose weight or just give up?</li><li>Caller #2 is Christian, 30yrs from Paranaque. Christian just broke up with his gold digger girlfriend as he couldn't take the constant requests for money. However, just this evening, she texted him and wanted some post breakup sex. Christian has already blocked her and just wants to move on, but an opportunity at some easy sex is hard to pass up. What should he do?</li><li>Caller #3 is Luke, 31yrs from Mandaluyong. Luke and his boyfriend have flirted with the idea of having a threesome. On a recent beach outing, they met a young guy that they thought would be the right cream to their Oreo cookie. Luke set some parameters of this possible threesome, most importantly, there needs to be transparency. If his BF contacts the guy, Luke needs to know about it so they can keep trust between them. Well, the BF didn't keep his end of the bargain as Luke snooped into his phone and found out that they have been texting and seeing each other. Luke is confused on what to do.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Anne, 35yrs from Pasig. Anne and her husband fight a lot about sex. He wants it more than shes willing to give it and it creates tension between them. Mo uses this call to talk about his own frustration with sexual frequency as his situation somewhat mirrors what Anne and her husband is going through. As with all problems in the world, the solution is simple --> morning blowjobs, and all will be right in the world.</li><li>Caller #2 is Al from Brisbane, Australia. Yes, we have heard this before, LDR relationships are hard. But while this may sound like a repetitive call, Al's LDR situation is a very interesting one. This call has it all. GF making out with other girls, dick pics being sent and Al's mom catching him taking it. Yeah, sicker than your average.</li><li>Caller #3 is Chan who is 17yrs old from Davao. Chan thinks he masturbates way too much. 6-10 times a day to be exact. But its a few other details about Chan that has Mo worried. Chan thinks he's addicted, Mo thinks 6-10 is right about where most teenagers jackoff on the daily. How about you? How often did you pull during your teenage days?</li><li>Caller #4 is Anthony from Barcelona, Spain. Anthony wants to know if he broke the bro code when he decided to date his bestfriends ex -- even if he got permission to do so. To add, this is a long distance relationship as his Spaniard girlfriend lives in Mallorca, but Mo gives his blessing. Anthony has been calling the show since he was 16, our resident boy is growing right before our eyes (sigh)</li>

                    <li>Caller #1 is Alaina, 36yrs from Toronto, Canada. Alaina doesnt have a question to ask Mo about herself, she wants to ask Mo about Mo! This is a pleasant change by switching the spotlight on our podcast host. Alaina has 5 questions ready for TPG and let's see how he answers them!</li><li>Caller #2 is Jamie 27yrs from San Francisco. Jamie is in an expensive LDR, but aren't they all? She's also interested in taking this relationship to the next level. As Mo says on the radio, there are some problems that can be fixed by simply throwing money at it. LDR's definitely need money to work.</li><li>Caller #3 is ShaSha who is 34yrs old in Doha, Qatar. ShaSha soon to be ex-husband is a douchebag and he is not cooperating with her request to get an annulment. He has blocked her on social media, he has a new girlfriend, he has in all aspects, moved on. Except he is giving her a hard time regarding the annulment papers even if ShaSha has offered to pay for it! Bitterness is strong is this man.</li><li>Caller #4 is Helen, 25yrs old from Cavite. Helen is a transgender who has sex with her boyfriend every weekend but because its unprotected sex, Helen is worried about STDs. I know, this sounds obvious -- wear a condom, but condoms are not fun -- until your dick falls off cuz of a disease.</li>

                    <li>Caller #1 is RGC who is 34yrs old from QC. Caller is having his first child and his wife is currently 5 months into the pregnancy. Like all first time parents, there are some unexpected changes that happen to each persons life and RGC understands that sex wont be happening for a considerable amount of time while his wife carries, gives birth and recovers. So, RGC has take it upon himself to jackoff every morning in the shower to get his regular sexual kicks. The problem is that he feels guilty about it. Is masturbating while your wife is pregnant wrong?</li><li>Caller #2 is Timmy, 23yrs old and also from QC. Many of you know Timmy as she was the Sharp Philippines winner of a TV for the first month of the podcast! Timmy is back for her Caller #3 call of the season and she is as interesting as ever. Timmy says she is finding it hard to get excited about her sex life because she has already checked off all the things she wanted to do on her sex bucket list. These things include a gangbang, a threesome, and getting involved with a married man. Now that her list is complete, she feels sexually empty. The call turns to shit when she reveals she gave a blowjob to her Victory pastor one day in his office. It's almost unbelievable!</li><li>Caller #3 is another repeat caller and one of Mo's favorites, Ninyo 37yrs from Lesotho, Africa. Ninyo thinks he smokes too much marijuana and he wants to know if it's okay. He also doesn't get why some cultures have such a negative stigma toward marijuana while others don't. This is weed talk, man. Puff, puff, give.</li><li>Caller #4 is Kyla who is 26yrs old from Paranaque. Kyla has a BIG problem, many of you in interracial marriages with Chinese partners call it, The Great Wall of China. Meaning, your partners family either doesn't know you or they hate you for being Pinoy and dating their child. Kyla's BF has yet to introduce her to the family because he's certain it will be a disaster. How long though can Kyla wait before it becomes a relationship killer? To add, their relationship and sex life has suffered because BF is consumed by the family business. How much longer can this go on?</li>

                    <li>Caller #1 is Kei who is 29yrs old from Manila. Kei has transformed an ex-boyfriend into a fuck buddy -- which is a dream situation for most guys. However, they have been fuck buddying for a few years now and while Kei is adamant she doesn't want to get back together with him, she cant deny that she has feelings for him even though she has dated and has had sex with other people. Maybe they're soul mates or just the perfect fit as sexual partners and nothing more.</li><li>Caller #2 is Miguel 30yrs old from Manila. Miguel is a smart, successful, healthy gym guy who is also a Paulo Avelino doppleganger. The problem is he can't find the confidence or game to turn that into chicks -- more specifically, into casual sex. He wants to have no strings attached hookups but being the introvert he is, he has been striking out with the females. He wants Mo to help him get sex since it's been 3 years since he has had any action.</li><li>Caller #3 is Gail, 30yrs old from Bulacan. Gail is a mother of two small children, 5 and 3. She is also a loyal partner to her live-in boyfriend. Unfortunately, her boyfriend cheated on her. Gail found out and turned into the fucking Terminator. She attacked the Caller #3 party female at her work place, rather viciously, that it landed her in the police station. The girl has apologized but she wants to bring more pain. Gail asked Mo if she thinks it would be a good idea to hire a hitman to continue to fuck her up even more. Wow.</li><li>Caller #4 is Cynthia and Olivia, both 25yrs old from Winnipeg, Canada. Cynthia is worried about her friend Olivia, who has never had a boyfriend in her life. However, recently she's been the target of a lot of male attention and Olivia has been making some questionable life choices. She's sleeping with two different men, one is married and the other is taken. She has recently lost over 70 pounds and after the strict diet and gym, there are guys who are showing interest and perhaps all this new attention is a bit overwhelming.</li>

                    <li>Caller #1 is Rema who is 26yrs old from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Rema has a hard problem -- her husband can't keep an erection and she thinks it's his sexual anxiety that stems from her high sex drive. They've got a great marriage, she says he's the perfect husband but the majority of the time they try having sex, he deflates and Rema is left with questions.</li><li>Caller #2 is Rose Ann who is 33yrs old from Dubai, UAE. Rose Ann and her husband have been trying to have a child for a few years and while doctors have cleared them from any medical issue that might be preventing them from conceiving, the whole process has left Rose Ann's husband uninterested in sex anymore. Aside from her sexual needs, she is now faced with not being able to have something she's always wanted -- a family, with children, of her own.</li><li>Caller #3 is Allan who is 30 from London, England. Allan's ex-boyfriend, showbiz personality Teejay Marquez, owes Allan some money -- to the tune of 10 million pesos. Allan wants to know if he should still pursue the case he has made on Teejay now that they no longer communicate. Knowing cases that involve showbiz personalities can become public, he just needs reassurance that he's doing the right thing.</li><li>Caller #4 is Mel, who is 23yrs old from Nagano, Japan. Mel has a good paying job in Japan but he calls in to tell Mo that he has yet to finish highschool and though he gets paid decently now, he feels empty without the highschool degree and is thinking of moving back to the Philippines to finish his studies. Mel has been working hard since his teenage years but the lack of education may limit how far he can get in life. Of course, if a person longs for more education, then that can never be a bad thing.</li>

              <div class="summary">Mo starts the show wondering as we hit the start of the 3rd month of this season, which topic/issue has been the most called about so far? Is it the LDRs, the sexless marriages, or the FUBU/FWB relationships that have gone wrong? Perhaps the first two calls can answer that question as we start with two mid-20's millennials who are having issues with their fuck buddies. Let's check them out!</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Ericka who is 24 yrs old from Manila. Ericka has hit the red zone when it comes to her fuck buddy -- meaning she is in month number 4 of the setup. Ericka is aware of Mo's 3 month rule, and par for the course, she is starting to develop some feelings for her FWB. However, what is different from many people who cross the 3 month line, Ericka wants to end the relationship because she'd like to make her career the priority. That's a pretty mature decision for a 24yr old. Good on her!</li><li>Caller #2 is Matt who is 26yrs old from QC. Matt, on the other hand, is starting to fall in love with his fuck buddy after only 3 weeks of regular sex! To make matters worse, his FWB treats him as both fuck bud and bro. Meaning, she confides in him about all the other guys shes in contact with and Matt feels bad about it.</li><li>Caller #3 is Israel who is 28yrs old from Las Pinas. Israel was let go by his long-time (11yrs) girlfriend recently and she told him to fix himself -- get his degree, a stable job, etc and she will consider coming back to him. When Israel failed to comply with her ultimatum, she went out and found herself another man. Israel saw photos of them last Wednesday on Facebook and he's so hurt about it that he is considering taking his life.</li><li>Caller #4 is Anna from Cebu, she's 33yrs old. Anna has been a single parent for the past 11 years. The father of her child left her before she gave birth and has recently tried to get back into her and the child's life. He has made strides in maturing, and is even a bit more spiritual. Anna has been burned before by him, but he seems changed. What to do about this situation after having to go through the past 11 years on her own?</li>

              <div class="summary">Its the third episode of this week and I hope you all have had a great time listening to the past few GTWM Podcast episodes! The poll for Caller of of the Month is up on Mo's Twitter account, so vote for your favorite. Winner gets gadgets from Sharp Philippines! Let's take a look at the caller lineup for this episode:</div>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Eri who is a 32yr old female from QC. Eri has never had a boyfriend and has never been on a date. From all the years of listening to the podcast, she has been able to conclude that men only want hot chicks. She says she's a 5 on the hot scale and wonders if she will ever be attractive and desirable enough for men to pursue her.</li><li>Caller #2 is May who is 31yrs old from Bicol. May is married to a great guy and she wants to make the marriage work. There's a slight problem. For many years, May has had feelings for a female friend of hers and she feels guilty in that as great as her husband is, she continues to feel strongly about her friend. Mo tells her if she wants to move on and concentrate fully on her marriage, she might need to break off the friendship she has with the other girl.</li><li>Caller #3 is J, 24yrs old from Manila. J cheated on his GF with a crazy ass girl he met. Shortly after the affair, he started to see posts on her FB of an ultra-sound and she said it was his baby. Unfortunately, she lost the pregnancy and J is now in the process of ghosting her. Is that the right move?</li><li>Caller #4 is Layla who is 30 from Newcastle, Australia. She's got a HUGE problem. Her neighbor is loud and she wants to know how to confront her about all the noise that keep Layla awake during sleep hours.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Jojo, who is 35yrs old from Montreal, Canada. Jojo just moved with his wife to Canada last year and she recently came out with a secret she's been hiding -- she cheated on her him while he was out of the country working. She said the affair lasted 4 months and while the guy (who was also married) would come over their house, nothing sexual happened. Jojo is finding it hard to believe sex wasn't involved.</li><li>Caller #2 is John Lloyd from Singapore, he's 37yrs old. JL has a problem with his wife's lesbian twin sister. He is against her bringing her girlfriend over to the house and sleeping there. He says it's a bad lesson for their young daughter but he doesn't know how to enforce his wishes to his wife & twin sister because they are so close. He is also frustrated that his wife rarely ever gives him a blowjob. To make matters worse, this is an LDR marriage. Tough times, man.</li><li>Caller #3 is Jack who is 30yrs old from Hong Kong. Jack is about to get married but he isn't too keen about inviting his estranged parents to the wedding. His parents hate each other and he and his sister are split in their loyalty to mom and dad. It's a sticky situation and Jack needs Mo's take in helping sort it out.</li><li>Caller #4 is Jerry who is 32yrs old from Quezon City. Jerry's and his wife are currently 6 months into a pregnancy when tragedy struck. Jerry's dog just died, like tonight. Jerry is a doctor so he understands the stress and possible complications that an incident like this can have on his wife and he's worried. He also wanted to call to just vent and talk about this big loss.</li>

              <div class="summary">Let's be honest, Saturday shows are our best episodes, yes? And E29 is no different! We have fresh newly recorded batch of calls that are certainly going to leave you shocked, relieved, informed and maybe even horny. Shall we undress the call log? Lets do it!</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Mark who is 28yrs old from Alabang. Mark is into some shit man. He starts with explaining how perfect his girlfriend is. She "makes hatid" (sorry na, Alabang eh) Mark nearly everyday. If his shoelaces are untied, she will bend down and tie them for him. (See: Alabang raised)</li><li>Caller #2 is Avie who is also 28yrs old from Dubai. Avie has been working the rounds on Tinder in Dubai these past few years. She has amassed an impressive number of fuck buddies and one night stands. However, Avie is thinking of getting out of the fubu game and into something more stable and exclusive. Enter: love interest from the U.K. Avie is really starting to like her new boy thang; however, she feels that Pinays have a bad reputation of only getting involved with white people for their citizenship. She wants to know if she should consider that -- and she also needed some tips on how to properly clean before anal sex. Yeah, this call has some variety.</li><li>Caller #3 is Rema who is 26yrs old from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Rema called last week about her husbands increasingly (oxymoron) deflating penis. Mo told her last week to not have any sex for 7 days and on Friday night, try giving him a blowjob in his sleep and then call back the show to see if it worked. Well, was TPG correct with his advice? Let's find out!</li><li>Caller #4 is Justin who is 32yrs old from Quezon City. Justin is worried that he might be obsessed with boobs. He can't stop staring and imagining them when he is out and about. He is a fan of all shapes and sizes and he'd like to ask Mo if his fetish for jugs might be a problem or a sickness.</li>

                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Nancy who is 39yrs old from Los Angeles. Nancy wants to dump her boyfriend but she feels guilty since he is not financially stable. Also, BF wants to have sex everyday and she doesn't find it enjoyable anymore with him. He gets angry if she doesn't give him a blow (though she did say she's amazing at BJ's) and he calls her demeaning names. I know, why even stay another day with this loser.</li><li>Caller #2 is Gerry who is 26yrs old from Bukidnon. Tell me if you have read this before, but Gerry wants to dump his boyfriend but he feels guilty since he is not financially stable. What differs from the first call is that Gerry's BF is in Dubai and is basically freeloading off of him. There is barely a relationship left here, yet Gerry is still financing every aspect of BF's life abroad.</li><li>Caller #3 is Kriezel who is 29yrs old from New York City. She just moved to NYC a week ago and has already built a little bit of a mutual understanding with a guy she has met online and has gone on 3 dates with him -- however, he's still on the dating app talking to other girls. What to do if in her shoes?</li><li>Caller #4 is 26 year old Stella from Taguig. Stella is on the tail end of her LDR -- meaning, they have succeeded and are close to moving in together and starting a life with her boyfriend who is a foreigner living in Egypt. Stella is nervous about all the big upcoming changes and just wants to make sure she's doing the right thing.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Arya, 35yrs old from Niagara Falls, Canada. Arya is a return caller but this time she wants to talk about her own love/sex life. Arya prides herself in being a professional fuck buddy -- which means she claims she can have a consistent fuck buddy and not develop feelings or fall in love. She said 7 months of banging the same guy and she can easily drop him like an algebra course in college if she wants to. Arya's armor is being tested though recently as she has been spending A LOT of time with a guy she met online and his daughter. Can Arya prove us wrong? We have seen in the history of this the show that no female can carry a long term fuck buddy without falling love, will she break?</li><li>Caller #2 is Erik from Manila who is 39yrs old. Erik is stuck at a crossroads. He is the cool guy boss with nearly 200 employees under his watch. He develops strong friendships with his co-workers and that type of work environment can have some pros and cons. Lets focus on a con. Erik has a good friend/coworker who has a girlfriend who also works in the company. Well, there's a sex tape of the girl floating around with her banging ANOTHER co-worker (not her boyfriend) and Erik has seen some screenshots. He asks Mo if he should tell his friend that the GF has a sextape going around the office which might get him involved in all this nastiness.</li><li>Caller #3 is Charles who is 28 from QC. Charles has been a straight guy, up to this point. He sexuality has taken a turn for the fluid recently as he has gotten quite close with another guy friend. The guy also introduced everyone to his boyfriend and now that Charles has found out the guy is gay, he too, in some kind of domino effect, has developed feelings for him. It's a very interesting scenario that you cant miss.</li><li>Caller #4 is 31yr old actress/model Daiana Menezes. Daiana opens up about a recent failed relationship that had become toxic because of her narcissistic ex-boyfriend. She had found herself yet another douchebag. Even more challenging, Daiana talks about her battle with breast cancer, something she is speaking about for the first time. There's a lot to take in in this call, lets give it a listen.</li>

              <div class="summary">This episode needs a pretty serious disclaimer. It's 2hrs and 40mins long. This might be the longest podcast episode in GTWM history -- fuck, it might be the longest podcast in PODCAST HISTORY. I know, a nearly 3hr show can either be awesome or blow up in our face. There's a reason it's 3hrs and that's because GTWM is as good as other 3hr things like flights to Singapore, Avengers End Game, a quadruple overtime NBA game, and so much more. Well, I don't want it to be any longer, here are the calls.</div>
              
                <div class="callers">

                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is also a one hour call and its from Instagram influencer David who is 33yrs old from Las Pinas. David is a wanderluster -- travels the world and takes awesome photos and he has been able to rack over 60,000 followers on IG because of it. He's living the good life. Retired at 33, very financially stable, and he has checked off every item on his bucket list. However, that's where the problem resides. In its truest form, now that he finished his bucket list, David wants to end his life and give his organs to charity. He said he's tired, he's bored, there's not much left to do in life at 33. Wow.</li><li>Caller #2 is 23yr old Lyn from Cebu. Lyn has never had a boyfriend since birth but that doesn't stop her from being sexually active with a good amount of men through the years. She wants the answer to the million peso question that many young women who have casual sex ask: why do I attract fuccbois and why do they become distant after sex? That's because ALL guys are inherently fuccbois. It's a learning moment for Lyn.</li><li>Caller #3 is Eu who is 25 years old from Camuiguin, but she's calling on vacation in Singapore. Eu is an only child lesbian from a political family. That situation makes her parents very involved in all matters. Eu is in the middle of a breakup, yet she's meeting other people on Tinder and she wants to know if she should make a play for her ex again or just move on with the people she finds online.</li><li>Caller #4 is RC from Novaliches, she's 33 years old. RC is tired of the daily grind in Manila -- living pay check to pay check, commuting ungoldly hours to work, and working so much overtime. She hears Mo praise Canada, and she wants to know if she can ever make it to one of those first world countries. She talks to Mo and Chopper about how to enhance her quality of life.</li>

Yes, today is the day that Mo, every year, hopes and wishes he would be woken up by his wife with a surprise blowjob. It's not a surprise if you publicly declare it every year, but alas, another Fathers Day has gone by and wala. LOL. However, his lovely wife, Angelicopter, is back for another episode so let's get to the details.</div>

                    <li>Caller #1 is Margaret who is 33yrs old from Lipa, Batangas. Margaret has been single for over a year now and she's coming off a 10 year marriage from the only guy shes dated/married in her adult life. They have 2 kids and Margaret wants to know how she can get back into the dating scene. She is not updated with all the hookup tech or even modern dating culture. Let's get this girl a date!</li><li>Caller #2 is MB who is 19yrs old from Cavite. MB is your somewhat typical 19 year old. He has a girlfriend because he wants to have sex, regularly. But he also wants to have a fuck buddy AND a girlfriend</li><li>Caller #3 is Christian who is 35yrs from Los Angeles. Like Margaret and MB, Christian is looking for companionship. He is a bank manager in LA and he even owns his own restaurant! He hasn't been on a date in years! He spends most of his time with his business, his career, and his child that he feels it's difficult to allocate a part of himself to his social life. There just aren't enough hours in a day, man.</li><li>Caller #4 is John who is 25yrs old from Subic. John has a classic Fathers Day problem and he wanted to get on the show to let if off his chest. John is a good guy and you'll see that from this call.</li>

                    <li>Caller #1 is IC who is 26yrs old from Tondo. IC's LDR girlfriend cheated on him with 7 different guys. 2 of them she had a steady fuck buddy arrangement with recently, with her fucking the 2 of them at an unheard of 5 times per week. GF came clean about the frequency and that she swallowed cum. TMI, if you ask me. IC says he loves her and wants to build trust again. I know, I'm laughing hysterically as well.</li><li>Caller #2 is 39yr old Nancy from Los Angeles. Nancy called in E30 and Mo told her that she needs to break up with her crazy ass boyfriend right away. Well, 3 weeks have gone by and she still hasn't done it. She calls back tonight to try to get more drive to finally pull the plug on this awful environment.</li><li>Caller #3 is Josh who is 27yrs old from Makati. Josh's GF is also cheating on him and he wants to know if he should get some revenge on the batch. Mo has eased up on the revenge talk through the years but he's always willing to make an exception.</li><li>Caller #4 is Yago who is 30yrs old from Manila. Yago and his best friend (who he works with) have recently been drifting apart with no explanation. Yago goes on to say that it's hurting him because he has fallen in love with her. She told him things need to be professional now and she is unwilling to even talk to him. He wants to know how to move forward with this.</li>

              <div class="summary">It's a Thursday night and we have another weekday episode of GTWM coming at ya! There'a s nice variety of calls in store for you all and I suggest you listen to the entire show and then head to the GTWM Reddit page to discuss it with your fellow listeners! Here are the details:</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is 28yr old Hazel from Pasig. Hazel is a mistress. And she initally wanted to call in the program to ask Mo about what is the proper etiquette of a mistress -- yes, I know it's a hard question to ask but this call turns away from the how to's and tips and becomes more of the profile of the manipulative men like Hazel is involved with. It's a great call.</li><li>Caller #2 is Jake who is 29yrs old in Manila. Jake has been in a band for the past 4 years and he averages about 6 gigs per week. The problem with Jake is that he needs to masturbate immediately before he takes the stage and that has led to some awkward places he has jacked off prior to performance time. Jake has a big event this Saturday and his band is getting fed up with his routine.</li><li>Caller #3 is Joe who is 27yrs old from Manila. Joe is a nurse who is on the verge on getting his visa to move to the US. He has never been there before and he has a few cities that he can choose to locate to. He wants to ask Mo about the USA life and whether he should pursue an amazing girl he likes even though he is leaving soon.</li><li>Caller #4 is Mary 26yrs from Las Vegas. Mary feels like her career is at a standstill. She has a job but no real bright future work-wise. So she is deciding on whether she should join the Air Force. Her worry is that deployment will take her away from her husband but the military is always a good way to jump start a dull career,</li>

              <div class="summary">It's a brand new week of podcasting and Mo owes you an episode to kick off this Monday night! I hope you all had a great weekend, void of any drama. If you didnt have enough of it, then let's bring drama for your door with Episode 36. Here are the details!</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Kris who is 36yrs old from Saskatchewan, Canada. Kris has been in a loveless marriage for 10 years now. She told herself (and her husband) that when her 9 year old daughter turns 19, she will divorce him and start her new life. However, at 36 years old, she is thinking of just leaving now so she can still have some of her youth and beauty left (and yes, she is beautiful.) Should she speed up her plans or wait the original 10 extra years?</li><li>Caller #2 is Early who is 27yrs old from Paranaque. Early saw her friends husband on Bumble last night. She wants to know if she should tell her friend (who is somewhat a newlywed and a new mother to a 2yr old) that she saw hubby trying to hook up. It's definitely a crossroad, I wonder which path you'd take.</li><li>Caller #3 is Chito from Manila. Chito is 36yrs old and he going through a rough patch with his partner. He is falling out of love with her and wants to know what his next step should be. They have 2 kids and his career has stalled because of all the drama at home.</li><li>Caller #4 is Jessica who is 25yrs old from Makati. Jessica is in an 11 month long Fubu situation and (jaw on the floor alert!) she has developed feelings for the guy. They started out as friends for a few years, then developed into FWB, and now she told him she wants more, he said he can't. But of course. No Fubu situation is the same, but c'mon, guys will take free sex for how ever long it is offered.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Jonnel who is 25 from Caloocan. Jonnel lives with his girlfriend and next to their house in her compound is the GF's brother and his wife. Well, GF's brother is an OFW so he is out of town most of the year. One day, Jonnel went home and saw his "sister-in-law" and he "accidentally" grazed his hand against her ass. According to Jonnel, it seemed like she liked it so he decided to do it again the next day and apparently, she enjoyed it even more. Now, it's decision making time. Does he take this as a sign that he should make a move? But what about his GF and her brother? Hot stuff here!</li><li>Caller #2 is Charles who is 28 from QC. If you can recall, Charles called on Episode 31 and he asked Mo what to do about his guy friend that he is developing feelings for. Charles has always been a straight guy, but something new is tickling inside him. Maybe it's the Pride Month festivities. Who knows? But Charles wants to make his move.</li><li>Caller #3 is Mela who is 30 from QC. Mela is a very pretty and very sexy single gal who doesn't seem to get guys to take her seriously. She has a lot of suitors but the ones she picks tend to hit it and quit it. She wants to know what to do.</li><li>Caller #4 is Cielo who is 23yrs old, also from QC. Cielo is another return caller who called earlier in Season 6 about a fuccboi who has been courting her for 3 months now. When she finally decided she wanted to have sex, it was THE FUCCBOI who declined! Cielo was left cold and confused.</li>

              <div class="summary">Chopper + Mo = Tension. Drama. Tears? And some love sprinkled in. It's always a good times when Mo's wife @angelicopter comes aboard the show. It's not surprising to see this might be an episode that takes you a few days to finish because it's so damn long. But long is good, girth is better -- and we have both on the show today! Lets get to the calls:</div>

                    <li>Caller #1 is Valerie who is 31yrs old from San Diego, USA. Valerie has a problem with her man, err, men. 4 of them! Oh yeah. She's technically single and he spends a lot of quality time and bedroom time with 4 guys. One is married. One is a co-worker. One is an ex. One is a guy from church. It's the ultimate game of Marry. Fuck. Kill. Good times!</li><li>Caller #2 is Tin who is 38yrs old from Batangas. Tin was in a loveless marriage for quite some time. Her husband was already fucking around and the days were numbered before this disaster of a marriage was going to end. All of a sudden, cooler heads prevailed and Tin and her husband had "The Talk" and it turned out great. They are working things out and it's always a good thing to see a family stick together and get thru the rough patch.</li><li>Caller #3 is Gabe, 23yrs old from Nagano, Japan. Gabe need advice on porn. Straight up.</li><li>Caller #4 is Marco from Milan, Italy. Marco is a 40yr old female that has imposter syndrome. Meaning, she never feels adequate enough even though she has a great career, she is accomplished and all around successful. But because as a child she was told she wasn't smart enough, she feels she needs to micromanage and over achieve constantly. Its an interesting situation for this impressive Pinay.</li>

Her boyfriend is Muslim and she is Christian and while they can't see eye to eye on their future, BF still wants sex. Shocker. Christine needs an exorcism from this guy.</li><li>Caller #2 is Michael, 24yrs, from Las Vegas. Michael's girlfriend is super sensitive. She cries about everything and he wants to know how to adjust to her personality and what help can he give to make her feel better about things.</li><li>Caller #3 is Pancho who is 26yrs old from Phoenix, Arizona. Pancho has met a girl he really likes. He even recently flew to Europe to spend time with her. However, there is a catch. She's got a benefactor and he is still paying the luxury apartment in Europe that she lives in. Should he continue to pursue this girl even if she has a sugar daddy?</li><li>Caller #4 is the return of Bianca Valerio!

In fact, this may be one of the best, most uplifting episodes in GTWM history -- at least that is what Mo is trying to theme for the next 2 hours. The calls for tonight are from people who have had adversity thrown their way, and somehow, are trying to find a way to power through them. We all have had bad days, even bad years, and while many of us choose to sulk and let negativity beat us, these 4 people rose above. Let's meet them now:</div>

                    <li>Caller #1 is Ria who is 38yrs old from Singapore. Ria's husband died tragically some years back and he was the love of her life. She has never fully recovered from the loss and yet, one of her friends -- who also knew her husband -- was there to comfort her throughout the process. And as many opposite sex shoulders to cry on, they developed a relationship. Recently, he proposed and immediately Ria was overwhelmed with a sense of guilt. Should she say yes? What would her husband think?</li><li>Caller #2 is Jojo who is 34yrs old from Malaysia. This just might be the weirdest, wildest, most depressing call GTWM has ever had. I just cant say anymore. Find out for yourself.</li><li>Caller #3 is Kimberley who is 47yrs old from Los Angeles. Kim's husband is very ill. He needs a new kidney and his health moving forward is extremely concerning. Kim wants to prepare for a future without him and is thinking of taking nursing in school so she can help keep the family afloat if/when her husband passes. Super mom, super wife.</li><li>Caller #4 is Trisha who is 29yrs old from Manila. Trish is a mother 2 and she came from a very abusive marriage. Since her trauma, she has been very reluctant to get into a new relationship. There's a guy who for the past 3 years has been a steady friend, more than a friend in fact, but shes been pushing away the idea of a relationship because she's scared of getting into another one.

She's brokenhearted about it and is contemplating quitting her job. Its a freakin' chaotic relationship, and you'll find out why,</li><li>Caller #2 is Eric who is 23yrs old from Cebu. Eric has a gay bestfriend who broke up with his very first boyfriend and he wants to help out with the moving on or the get back together process. Eric is a good guy and who says that gay bestfriends are only for girls?! Thumps up to Eric!</li><li>Caller #3 is Al, 25yrs old, from Brisbane, Australia. Simply put, Al wants anal sex with his girlfriend. He needs help on how to get it done.</li><li>Caller #4 is Sara who is 28yrs old from Dubai.

Sure that's possible but Yana also found an STD on Tinder from her new boyfriend. It's currently long distance but the guy seems to be serious about her. He hasn’t said the "I love you" phrase and Yana wants to make sure this relationship is a strong long term one.</li><li>Caller #2 is Valerie who is 31 from San Diego. Valerie called 10 episodes ago and she is the girl who is juggling 4 men. She calls in to update us about her fuck buddy, the doctor.

JL is getting married in April of 2020. His fiancé is in England and while he wants to move there to be with her after the weeding, he is thinking twice about leaving his career in the PH where he gets to do what he really loves. He wants Mo's take on the big move to the UK.</li><li>Caller #4 is Gretchen who is 33yrs old from New York. Gretchen is also a return caller who just broke up with her boyfriend last night and she thinks it's because she is too bossy. She has a bit of a temper that tends to drive guys away.</li>

Angel doesn’t seem to mind because the sex was so good.</li><li>Caller #2 is Jacob from Toronto, Canada. Jacob is cheating on his girlfriend with a friend of hers. He and the new girl want an exclusive relationship so Jacob is conflicted on how to tell his current GF about the sitaution.</li><li>Caller #3 is Rikki who is 28yrs old from Sydney, Australia.

You thought this shit was romantic, didn't you?</li><li>Caller #4 is Tim who is in Brisbane, Australia. Tim cheated on his wife with a co-worker and it got him fired. Now living in AUS, he has been able to get a new job and repair things with his wife. He now wants to fix things with all the people in his old profession. That's probably a bad idea.</li>

Dani is a late bloomer when it comes to dating. She only had her first boyfriend last year. She kinda has a type -- Nigerian men.

Casey broke up with her girlfriend because GF is still communicating with her ex-boyfriend. But now ex-GF wants to keep in touch with Casey and even be intimate with her while she's still seeing her once ex-BF.

They're not necessarily updates from past calls, but more familiar people who want to ask something new or about their current dilemmas. So let's get to the good stuff:</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Yana who is 26yrs old from Manila and she called on Episode 47. Yana wants to talk about guys who don't go down on their girls. It's selfish and not cool at all!</li><li>Caller #2 is Jake who is 26yrs old from Toronto, Canada. Jake's GF cheated on him AGAIN with her boss AGAIN! Now it's time for Jake to dump this bitch but before he does, he wants sweet revenge. Don't we all?</li><li>Caller #3 is Ace who is 23yrs old from Vancouver, Canada. Ace is a caller from Episode 16 and she wants to ask Mo and Chopper about who makes the first move when both parties are hesitant (torpe) in person. Mo and Chop talk about their own awkward start.</li><li>Caller #4 is Jojo who is 34yrs old from Malaysia. Many of you may remember Jojo from his explosive call on Episode 43. Yeah, hes the one. Tonight he calls back frustrated that in the last 3 months, we DIDN’T have sex 3 times. Meaning, he has had sex 87 times out of the last 90 days -- and those 3 days are frustrating for him. He's "butt hurt" about it. LOL.</li>

              <div class="summary">Yeah baby! It's the middle of the long weekend and we have more GTWM Podcast episodes to upload for you all! We have some island fever on the show tonight as Mo takes calls from Guam, the Bahamas, and the Philippines! There will be some cheating, some tears, and some laughs in this episode so let's get ready to rumble. The list:</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Rico who is 35yrs old from the Bahamas. Rico's wife cheated on him and he found out that the guy was a common friend. So when the dude showed up at his wife's birthday party last Saturday, Rico took the opportunity to beat his ass down. Luckily he didn't go to jail for it but he wants to ask Mo if she should give his wife a second chance. This is a great call.</li><li>Caller #2 is Rafaela who is 29yrs old from Guam. Simple, Rafa got a hold of her BF's text messages and he's been banging other women -- a lot of them. Some of them are married, some are engaged, some of the girls are her friends. Rafaela is naturally super pissed but should she tell everyone about her BF knowing it will ruin his life.</li><li>Caller #3 is Saab who is 26yrs old from Manila. Saab's boyfriend ghosted her 2 years ago and she didn't know what hit her. Now that the Gerald/Julia issue is the talk of the town, Saab can finally put a phrase to her experience -- she was GHOSTED. The whol showbiz ordeal is a helping her cope with what she endured some years back.</li><li>Caller #4 is Tokyo who is 27yrs old from Manila. Tokyo's boyfriend DM's other girls when she and he fight. He's got a go to girl that he messages when things are good and she found out about it and gave him the boot. It's called microcheating and she wasn't tolerating it. Is that too quick and too small of a reason to break up with him?</li>

              <div class="summary">It's the 3rd episode of this weekends batch of GTWM shows and Mo decided to go with a non-sexual theme for tonight -- meaning, no raunchy sex questions. Why? Cuz it's Sunday, you fucking sinners. Honestly, there just wasn’t a lot of sexual problems that people had this weekend so let's look beyond the bedroom for some interesting questions our global audience has come up with.</div>
              
                <div class="callers">

                    <li>Caller #1 is Rachel who is 31yrs old from Manila. Rachel and her BF have planned a 5 day vacation to Japan! The problem is that BF wants 2 of the 5 days spent alone so he can enjoy IG for himself. Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.</li><li>Caller #2 is Mary Grace who is 29yrs old from Niagara Falls, Canada. Mary Grace wants to move to Toronto and experience city living, however, she doesn't know how to tell her parents that shes moving away. Lolo and Lola are very close o the kids as well so she's nervous about the conversation to move away.</li><li>Caller #3 is James who is 30yrs old from Manila. James has a gay co-worker that he might think likes him. He isnt sure and while James is very supportive of the LGBTQ community, he notices that is co-worker has been grumpy recently and he thinks it might be because he has been trying to distance himself from the guys "advances"</li><li>Caller #4 is Enrique from New York. Enrique has recently wrote a book about how unattractive men can score attractive women. Mo has always been against workshops and books about this because it usually crashes and burns in real life. Lets see if this one is different.</li>

It doesn't get sadder than this story.</li><li>Caller #4 is Rob who is 31yrs old from Sydney. Rob had a college crush that he tried to court but was basted. As he's gotten older, they have kept in touch and now it's her who wants Rob in her life. The problem is Rob has a boyfriend and she doesn’t know he's bisexual. The girl has booked a trip for the both of them to spend a weekend in Singapore and Rob doesn’t know if he should go to check off this girl on his bucketlist.</li>

                    <li>Caller #1 is Issa who is a 19yr old DLSU student from Manila.

JB is cheating weekly on his much older boyfriend with random guys he meets online. Hes cheated well over a hundred times.

              <div class="summary">Titas of Manila, let's volt in! Yeah, tonights episode features two interesting calls from women 40 and above. I love these two calls and I always enjoy seeing the range between caller ages, countries, lifestyles, etc. That's what makes GTWM Podcast such a good show -- it's for everyone. In fact, focus on the differences alone between the male and female callers on this episode tonight. It's hilarious. Here are the calls:</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Miguel who is 25yrs old from Costa Rica. Miguel wants to share with Mo that his girlfriend bursts out in laughter every time she reaches orgasm. He finds it to be unique and sometimes uncomfortable because he often would lose his erection. LOL.</li><li>Caller #2 is Jo who is 41yrs old from New York. Jo, in her tita age of 41, has just come across sexting. She's modernized to the times when it comes to her dating life and she wants to share her interesting story with us.</li><li>Caller #3 is Mary who is 50yrs old from Cavite. Mary comes from a prominent political family in Cavite and she is also a retired agent. She has found herself in an LDR relationship with a guy 22 years younger than her. The guy is also currently in a US jail serving time for "bogus" attempted murder charges against his ex-girlfriend. Mary needs to come up with a million dollars bail for him but she isn't sure if she should go back to the US to do it.</li><li>Caller #4 is Mike who is 38yrs old from Laguna. Mike tried to go old school by masturbating with any pornography. You can assume what happen, err, didn’t happen next.</li>

                    <li>Caller #1 is Gwen who is 27yrs old from Dubai. Gwen's girlfriend (another LDR) has been starting to get distant from her shortly after her new promotion at work. Like Mo always says, change is so often the enemy of relationships. Are they falling apart?</li><li>Caller #2 is Chris who is 35yrs old from London, England. Chris went a bit wild recently on Tinder and she got pregnant from a local Brit who immediately ditched her. Now, her ex-boyfriend (who is 50+ yrs old AND LDR) wants her back but she isn't in love with him. He, however, would be the ideal father figure for the baby and she wants to ask Mo if she should get back together with him for that reason.</li><li>Caller #3 is Ana who is 30yrs old from Manila. Ana wants to ask a question about something Mo brings up on the podcast often: Why do guys like going after girls who are weak or vulnerable?</li><li>Caller #4 is Michael who is 29yrs old from Munich, Germany. Michael has a good job, he's a nurse, but he's miserable in Germany. He lives near the hospital he works in, he has no friends, the language barrier is a problem, and he misses his girlfriend. He's thinking of leaving GER and head back home because he's getting depressed. Should he leave Europe and head back home?</li>

Not sure if this is a new hot thing or it's pretty creepy. Perhaps you guys should decide.</li><li>Caller #2 is Tuesday who is 44yrs old from Manila. Tuesday is dating a girl who is in an open relationship with a girl who is dating a married man. He's starting to fall in love with her but he is aware that if he formalizes anything with her, it wont be an exclusive thing cuz that's not her style.</li><li>Caller #3 is Louise who is 24yrs old from Bohol. Louise wanted to talk to Mo about her mom who was in a relationship with her lesbian first cousin. It has affected her family but they are trying to piece things back together.</li><li>Caller #4 is Dray who is 36yrs old from Manila. Dray's girlfriend lied to him about not having kids. She has two of them! She's withheld some other pretty important information about who she really is and Dray thinks these red flags are HUGE problems. Yes, we agree.</li>

It's GTWM Podcast S06E71 and tonight we have calls from all over the world asking less than scandalous questions about love, life, and career.

While it's not as common practice as it is in the Philippines, circumcision is very much part of Filipino male culture. Cut that tip off!</li><li>Caller #2 is Mico who is 32yrs old from Los Angeles, California. Mico is going back to the Philippines very soon for a vacation and he wants to know the proper etiquette when he has to take out his family to dinner.</li><li>Caller #3 is Marou who is 30yrs old from the United Arab Emirates. Marou's girlfriend recently quit her job and shes now thinking of moving to another country. Marou is a disciple of the podcast and she knows LDR just don't work. She needs some guidance on what to do about her career and love life.</li><li>Caller #4 is Thomas who is 38yrs old from New Mexico. Thomas called in S06E17 and he seems to still have the same problem -- he wants to fuck hot guys, he's gay, he's not out of the closet, and he lives in farmland. You add all that together and you have Thomas, a guy who hasn't had sex in 4 years! He wants to ask how he can finally get some dick.</li>

The end of the decade is upon us and if youre having a rough 2019 or a rough 2010s, let's get on the right side and end it on a positive note -- or at least, better than some of these callers lined up.</div>

Well, in her excitement of the guy, she has regular cybersex sessions with him. Probably a really bad idea.</li><li>Caller #2 is Rae who is 28yrs old from Manila. Rae's brother -- who has angry issues -- just pulled a knife on himself and somewhat threatened to hurt his young son. This prompted Rae and family to have him admitted to the psych ward. Tough times ahead for them.</li><li>Caller #3 is Sam who is 30yrs old from Bulacan. Sam has had a rough 2019 to say the least. He hit rock bottom with his business, his wife left him with his 2 kids for another man and now he's dating a bipolar girl in her mid-twenties. Sam needs some guidance and perhaps a small kick in the ass to get started on the right path.</li><li>Caller #4 is Sanrio who is 40yrs old from Tokyo. Sanrio recently moved to Japan this past year and she's struggling with the change. To make things worse, her Japanese husband doesn't give her any money -- not even a piso. She has started taking on jobs as a housekeeper and even flirting with the idea of being a GRO. She's miserable, she hasn't worked at all during her adult life and she doesn't know if she should leave her husband, but they have a 14 year old son.</li>

After getting caught, her hubby did "all the right things" in asking for forgiveness but as with all our callers tonight, it's just so difficult to trust again.</li><li>Caller #3 is Alex who is 29yrs old from Melbourne, Australia. Alex is dating a guy who doesn't have a digital footprint. No FB, no IG, no anything. You can't even search him on Google and get a single return. Is that a cause for concern? It's 2020 and there is no trace of him online.</li><li>Caller #4 is Rasj who is 36ys old from Sydney, Australia. Rasj also caught her husband cheating and is trying to patch her life back together. If theres one thing we have learned tonight is that forgiving is hard and forgetting/getting over the pain sometimes feel impossible.</li>

But alas, we are here for episode 24 to try to bring some good times to your lives on this Wednesday night. We are all over the world this evening and let's get this show on the road:</div>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Kris who is 32yrs old from QC. Kris caught her husband texting and flirting with a girl from the office and she followed the exact steps on what to do to handle the situation. It really is a workshop in the school of setting your husband straight.</li><li>Caller #2 is Jack who is 31yrs old from Toronto. Jack and his barkada has had enough of this social distancing drama. They are planning their first barkada orgy this Saturday as a YOLO/Fuck-You-COVID-You-Don’t-Own-Me fuckfest and he wants Mo to give his blessing for this weekends activities!</li><li>Caller #3 is Alex who is 29yrs old from Melbourne, Australia. Alex just started dating this guy she really likes right before the lockdown started to happen. Like many who are new in a relationship, she is wondering how will this social distancing affect a new thing.</li><li>Caller #4 is Eric who is 40yrs old from Singapore. Eric thinks he might be fired from work because of the coronavirus and its impact on the economy. He is calling a mere one hour before his boss talks to him -- and this is a reality that many of us, including myself, may face…soon.</li>

              <div class="summary">Hey! Look at us! Mo is back for an episode this week, just in time to start the month of April. As you may know, Mo (like so many others out there) is in quarantine/isolation for 2 weeks due to symptom that just might be the coronavirus. Luckily, he isn't confirmed to have it as of now but with children at home, he was told to take precautions and stay away. Good for us is that he is quarantined in his studio! As we have 4 calls to knock out tonight:</div>

                    <li>Caller #1 is Michael who is 40yrs old calling from a hospital in Manila where he is a surgeon helping the fight. After a bit of corona talk, Doc Mike opens up about the struggles he faces at home with his very dominant Type A wife. He does not know how to address her aggressive style of parenting and being a good partner in this marriage.</li><li>Caller #2 is Brandon who is 29yrs old from QC. Brandon is in lockdown with his live-in girlfriend but the problem is that they just broke up. It's kinda funny to think two people living in are no longer together and can't separate so easily cuz of the Cov.</li><li>Caller #3 is Mikee who is 23yrs old from Laguna. Mikee wants to keep it light. She needs Mo's recipe for his famed easy to make french toast.</li><li>Caller #4 is Kat who is 39yrs old from Toronto. Kat just met a guy on Tinder who has a huge dick and want anal. She's very much attracted to his intelligence but the big dick plus anal might be a deal breaker.</li>

She's a mom now and we see some maturity in Ellen after all that she's been through.</li><li>Caller #2 is Andre who is 15yrs old from Manila. Andre fucked up big time. His FUBU, who is also 15, just returned positive test -- not for Covid-19, but a pregnancy test! At 15yrs old and a fuccboi, Andre wants to ask Mo what to do regarding this huge life-changing dilemma.</li><li>Caller #3 is Kris who is 38yrs old from Pasig. Kris' fuck buddy tried to give him a chance to make things exclusive but she ended up declining that possibility but she wants to keep him as a Fubu. He is reluctant to do it because he has feelings but would you give up an opportunity to continue to fuck your crush?</li><li>Caller #4 is Samantha who is 30yrs old from New Zealand. Sam feels survivors guilt as her job has fired the majority of the people in her office. Because she was spared from termination, she feels bad that her friends are gone and she has stayed with the company. With so many people losing work cuz of the 'Rona, how can she feel good about still working?</li>

It's Holy Week all over the Catholic world and while we usually take this time to have a nice, well deserved breather from work -- it hardly feels any different from the past few weeks during this lockdown period. Shit is closed, streets are relatively empty, summer in Asia is in full swing and there's not much to do but thank the Risen Lord that we have podcasts! Some fun calls here tonight so let's check them out:</div>

                    <li>Caller #1 is Saab who is 27yrs old from Manila. Saab has a pretty strong feeling (and some compelling evidence) that her boss is trying to hook up with her. It's gotten to a point wherein she's turning in her resignation letter but she doesn’t want to get involved with him since he's married. He's also a young and hot dude and the temptation is so strong that she needs to quit. Is that the right move?</li><li>Caller #2 is Vince who is 23yrs old from Leyte. Vince believes his girlfriend is having an affair (or on the verge of) with her boss, who is from England. Now that his GF has been crying because her boss had to be sent back to England cuz of Covid-19, Vince wants to use this opportunity to try to win his GF back.</li><li>Caller #3 is Mark who is 37yrs old from Charlotte. Mark is a Purple Heart recipient and he wanted to share his story with frontliners of the Covid-19 pandemic.</li><li>Caller #4 is Andrea who is 28yrs old from Manila. Andrea has taken Mo's advice that instead of fucking taken men, if she wants sex she should just casually fuck a friend. Things have been working out well for her now but because of the lockdown, her guy friend is now asking for nudes since they can't bang. She is tempted to send him some but she wants Mo's take on it first.</li>

What we do have though is another podcast episode for you all. This is a good one to make sure to download it and give it a listen. Here's what is on the menu:</div>

Something fresh and new might help, so let's talk to 4 callers -- all Manila based -- in this Episode 30 of the show. GTWM welcomes back long time co-host Mara Aquino today and some very interesting callers to follow. Let's check it out:</div>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Mara Aquino who is now 32yrs old from Manila. Mara has been in lockdown by herself for the past few weeks and she is at a point wherein she is so alone that she is starting to question whether she really exists or not. The lack of communication with the outside world has made her feel like she's on an island - Tom Hanks Castaway style and she might be losing touch with reality.</li><li>Caller #2 is Cassie who is 30yrs old from Manila. Cassie is in a new relationship with a guy she met on Tinder who lives in the U.K. The worldwide lockdown has made them cancel an upcoming Singapore trip and it might even cancel the rest of their relationship.</li><li>Caller #3 is May who is 21yrs old from Manila. May is also in a new relationship that is being threatened by the Covid-19 pandemic. Mo is starting to lose faith in most, if not all, new relationships that have blossomed in the past few months due to the restrictions and social distancing.</li><li>Caller #4 is Gerald who is 31yrs old from Manila. Gerald called in 2011 and was having suicidal tendencies due to his girlfriend cheating on him. Cut to nearly a decade later and he has been able to piece his life together even though he has yet to love as strongly as he did back then. Single, and most importantly, stable -- Gerald calls to check in with Mo after all these years.</li>

She since had a miscarriage but he doesn't know about it and he continues to send her money for the baby. Should she return it?</li><li>Caller #2 is Ken who is 34yrs old from Laguna. Speaking of babies, Ken is the father of a nearly 1 year old boy. But because quarantine dictates he stays home, he is now more exposed to the baby and all the challenges of raising a child and it's nearly driving him nuts. How to cope with the rigors of caring for a baby that always cries?</li><li>Caller #3 is Nicolette who is 29yrs old from Los Angeles. Nicolette is in a relationship wherein the rules and boundaries for her and her partner aren't equal. It's a common problem with couples but one that can totally build resentment.</li><li>Caller #4 is Louise who is 27yrs old from Kuwait. Louise met a French guy before the lockdown in Kuwait happened. They were able to go out on one date -- made out, he grab her tits, pinched her ass but no sex. They're still texting everyday and she wants to know if this is something she can build off of or is he just another Tinder fuccboi.</li>

              <div class="summary">It's been a week since our last episode and many of you are likely aware why -- it's been a tragic week in the Mo/Chopper household. Angelika lost her brother Francis to complications from Covid-19. This coronavirus has been such a mainstay topic on the show for the past few months and today, the biggest fear has impacted the life of one of our truly loved people on this show. To Angelika and her family, I hope you keep them in your thoughts during this difficult time. To take a break from all of the unfortunate events at home, Mo has put an episode together as a bit of a momentary escape even if it is for just a few hours. Let's try to find some kind of normalcy in tonights episode. Here are the details:</div>

                    <li>Caller #1 is DingDong Dantes who is 39yrs old from Makati. DD and Mo talk about life in lockdown for one of the countries biggest stars. From parenting to work ethic, it's a nice dive into how DingDong sees certain aspects of life. It's a really good chat.</li><li>Caller #2 is Mike who is 29yrs old from Dallas, Texas. Mike is married to a Filipina but for the first bunch of years it was an LDR marriage. Now that she is in the US with him, they are finding themselves in challenges that are unique to close quarter relationships. Unique is an understatement here -- listen to find out why.</li><li>Caller #3 is Jane who is 23yrs old from BGC. Jane's live in partner has ghosted her during this lockdown period. The problem is he encouraged her to quit her job, which she did, and move to Cavite, which she followed, only to have left her without a word or reason.</li><li>Caller #4 is Noey who is 35yrs old from Los Angeles. Noey has been reckless with his social distancing habits and it's because he recently met a girl and they are in their honeymoon stage and long for each others company. Especially at a time like this, it's more important to quarantine than ever but he's really into this girl and he wants to make sure they are exclusive to survive this pandemic. This call is gonna make your teeth hurt.</li>

The month of April is coming to an end as this weird year just keeps getting weirder.

That’s usually not an effective way to get your ex back.</li><li>Caller #2 is Echo who is 24yrs old from Manila. Echo doesn't want to kiss his GF after she gives him a blowjob because he thinks it's gross that his dick was just in her mouth.</li><li>Caller #3 is Tina who is 25yrs old from Manila. Tina, like thousands of others, just got dumped during this ECQ period in the Philippines. The 'rona isn't just taking lives, but it's taking relationships and Tina is its most recent casuality.</li><li>Caller #4 is Al who is 29yrs old from Manila. Al is a closet bi-sexual and recently started a "friendship" with a younger girl in the office who had no same sex relationship experience. After a few sleepovers and intimate moments, their friendship has cooled off drastically. Al wants to know if she stands a chance in saving this or if it's long gone.</li>

Mavics GF of 11 years broke up with her and is now living in with a new girl.

Lian broke up with her long time boyfriend earlier this year. It was a toxic relationship but one she is thinking about rekindling despite all of its flaws. There is a new guy though she's banging, he's from Tinder. He might just be the thing she needs to get over her BF.</li><li>Caller #3 is Neil who is 27yrs old from San Diego. Neil has had a lot of mom issues and the one thing that drove him away from her was when her would come home to listen to her moan and dirty talking some guy on the phone. He wants to know if he should patch things up with his mom.</li><li>Caller #4 is John who is 40yrs old from Manila. John noticed today that Mo might have HSP, a personality trait that makes him hyper sensitive to EVERYTHING around him -- 24/7.

                    <li>Caller #1 is EJ who is 25yrs old from Manila. EJ is originally from South Cotabato and he has always had a calling of finishing med school, becoming a neuro-surgeon and heading back to his province to provide health care for his people. However, during this pandemic he has seen how shit the government is and he is now thinking about leaving the country instead. It's a great conversation that you should all hear from a promising young man.</li><li>Caller #2 is Matt who is 27yrs old from QC. Matt called last year (S06E26) saying he is developing feelings for his fuck buddy. Cut to today and he was able to turn the ex-fubu into a girlfriend! Things are going great and he wants to ask Mo how much he can expect from this relationship since she is only in her early 20s.</li><li>Caller #3 is JV who is 31yrs old from Manila. JV wants to propose to his girlfriend soon but he is scared since she has made it known that she is unsure if she can co-exist with his daughter that he had prior to them getting together. It's a call that can really test your will power.</li><li>Caller #4 is Gelo who is 39yrs old form Manila and he wants to ask Mo about his take regarding the NBA possibly returning this July. Is it too early, is it safe enough, will it be enjoyable to watch? They then extend the conversation about whether we should hold out our kids from school until a vaccine is available.</li>

              <div class="summary">Friyay night baby! We are finally at the weekend but it feels like a weekend everyday these past few months. That might come to an end by Monday as the Philippines gets ready to open up its quarantine restrictions a little bit in an attempt to get some normalcy going. Well, here on the show, it's always business as usual and tonight we have 3 calls from the Philippines and 1 in Europe. Let's check out the details:</div>

                    <li>Caller #1 is Lucy who is 35yrs old from Cebu. Lucy is NBSB (No Boyfriend Since Birth) -- and that’s nothing -- no dates, never been kissed, never done ANYTHING. Well, the time off during Covid-19 made her realize that putting work before social life might have been a mistake and she wants to fix that by having sex immediately after quarantine restrictions are lifted.</li><li>Caller #2 is Isa who is 27yrs old from London, England. Isa has cheated on ALL her boyfriends. The career cheating has made her seek a therapist because she is currently engaged and she wants to have a better life as a wife.</li><li>Caller #3 is Jake who is 25yrs old from Batangas. Jake is a sneakerhead but he doesn’t buy the big ticket shoes because the shoe collecting game has gotten ridiculous expensive. He shares his story of how a young man like him hustles to buy the things he wants.</li><li>Caller #4 is Sam who is 29yrs old in Antipolo. Sam is bipolar and she wants to know if she should stay in her relationship considering the manic episodes she will find herself in. Her boyfriend is super supportive but they have been together since their teenage years and that’s usual the kiss of death.</li>

                    <li>Caller #1 are Sophie and CJ, 22yrs and 21yrs old respectively, both from Singapore. Sophie is bi-curious and is interested in having a threesome with her bf CJ and another girl to help satisfy her curiosity. CJ has had threesomes before but Sophie admits that she is a bit of the jealous type so how can they have a threesome without her feeling bad about the other girl and CJ?</li><li>Caller #2 is Monique who is 30yrs old from Manila. Monique is married to her Indian husband that moved to the Philippines 6 months ago for her. But these past few months she has realized that they are not compatible and she has jumped on Bumble meeting other guys. She wants to give up on him but is it too soon?</li><li>Caller #3 is Mike who is 30yrs old from Dallas, Texas. Mike is one of our more fascinating callers this Season 7 as he is the guy that married his transgender wife but they continue to fight like crazy since she moved to the US. Mike, like the last time, has a lengthy (pun) conversation with Mo about dicks - specifically, how Pinoys get circumsized.</li><li>Caller #4 is Ben who is 34yrs old from Doha, Qatar. Ben is a flight attendant whose career has been affected by Covid-19. He wants to know if he should stay in this position that he has held for 8 years or move on from it so he can find himself in a job, preferably in the US.</li>

              <div class="summary">June hasn’t calmed down either. Welcome to another GTWM Podcast episode as we start a new month but the world is as volatile as ever. COVID cases are rising again and the US is in complete disarray. There are problems as a whole and there are problems that are down to the individual level. Lets try to tackle the latter here and talk about the challenges many of you guys are going through whether it's love, life, or sex. We have a great show lined up and lets check it out:</div>

Angel is a successful airline purser who is married to a guy that doesn't have a lot of ambition. Whether this is Covid influenced or not, her being home with her husband more now makes her aware of some of the red flags she sees in him and she wants out.</li><li>Caller #3 is Mica who is 29yrs old from Negros. Mica is a doctor who is getting serious with her diplomat boyfriend. He wants a family but he is assigned to Germany for the next 5 years and he wants her to come with him -- but what about her medical career? Should she give up all that she studied and worked for to be a diplomats wife in a foreign country?</li><li>Caller #4 is Diether who is 26yrs old from Manila. Diether is frustrated that the lockdown and the lack of sex has him itching to get on Manila Tonight and look for a prostitute. No sex in 3 months is starting to make him feel the pressure to engage in it.</li>

Boyet's early 20's sister got pregnant by her abusive boyfriend and while he considers himself pro-life, he assisted her in getting an abortion. The problem is they did it in a really shady place and he even had to bury the baby himself in their backyard. Fucking insane.</li><li>Caller #2 is Abby who is 44yrs old from San Diego. Abby is a 44 year old virgin. 44! She,s successful, she lives in a great city, but she has never had a warm naked man in her bed. So she's ready to fix all that but how does she go about it? Cowboys 4 Angels, baby!</li><li>Caller #3 is John who is 31yrs old from Manila. John's wife cheated on him many years ago, yet even today it sends chills throughout his body whenever he thinks of it.

Yes, this might be the first time in GTWM history that we are not taking a single relationship or sex question in one episode. That doesn’t mean it's not an interesting show, I actually think this will be filled with thought-provoking topics -- just minus the cum, lol. So let's check out what we have here in Ep 52:</div>

More than ever, political affiliation defines what kind of person you are, and whether you are dateable or not.</li><li>Caller #2 is Ricardo who is 37yrs old from Stockholm, Sweden. Ricardo's father, who left him for another family when he was a young boy, is dying. And his family members have reached out to Ricardo for support, mainly financial. Ricardo does not want to help him but he feels a little guilty about it. What would Mo do?</li><li>Caller #3 is Joseph who is 36yrs old from Manila. Joseph has the world's worst boss. And his shitty boss has even been able to level up during the Covid-19 ordeal. Speaking of shitty, Joe know wants to literally shit on his boss' property. What would Mo do here as well?</li><li>Caller #4 is Trish who is 24yrs old from Manila. Trish is a young attractive 20 something that enjoys traveling alone. But there are fears associated with a girl that travels by herself -- mainly being safety. It's not common for a Filipina to do this so Trish wants to get on with Mo to talk about why she does it, how she navigates through the fears and threat and how she says no to all the men from abroad that hit on her.</li>

Hannah has been a mainstay caller for 5 years and she is calling in with another classic Hannah query -- she's dating two guys, both have pros and cons, one might be bisexual, the other is willing to fund her law school and housing -- yeah, typical Hannah drama.</li><li>Caller #3 is Charlene who is 24yrs old from Manila. Charlene is a young doctor that is new to the podcast. She regrets having used sex to make guys like her in the past. She would like to tell Mo that she has learned a lot from the pod and she is trying to incorporate the new lessons with a guys she is talking to now.</li><li>Caller #4 is Carlos who is 30yrs old from Los Angeles.

                    <li>Caller #1 is Dom who is 34yrs old in Manila. Dom just received a message and a terrifying photo from someone in his condo.

Kim has a new boyfriend and he is super serious about her. She is his first GF so he's really excited about the relationship that he wants to move in with her and he is already talking about marriage and kids. Theres a twist. He's rich. Like really rich. Like his family won the largest amount in Massachusetts State Lottery history, rich! He doesn’t work. Doesn’t need to and that might be a problem for her.</li><li>Caller #3 is George who is 23yrs old from Bacolod. George has a bit of an emergency as well. He thinks he just got catfished on Bumble while having a bit of a sex chat with a girl who wanted to see his dick.

Jodi's BF doesn't seem to want to commit to her even though they've been together for a long time. She is entering that stage in her life wherein she wants to settle down.

We have a good show in store tonight so I hope it fills up some quality time for all of you. Let's check out the call list:</div>

                    <li>Caller #1 is McCoy who is 25yrs old from Pasig. McCoy slept with one of his kabarkada's ex-GF shortly after their breakup. He broke the bro code but she has ghosted him and he wants to know what's up with that.</li><li>Caller #2 is Ellie who is 25yrs old from QC. When Ellie was in highschool, her teacher tried making a move on her. He eventually was persistent enough, and manipulative enough, to seduce her into a 3 year sexual relationship even if he was engaged. That teacher is now married and Ellie wants to know if she's a) a victim and b) how to get revenge.</li><li>Caller #3 is LJ who is 30yrs old from Singapore. LJ has a problem with guys who keep standing her up. They invite to meet up with her, but when time comes for her to show up, they are nowhere to be found. It's kind of odd that it's happening as frequently as it is considering LJ seems to be a really cool girl!</li><li>Caller #4 is Andy who is 34yrs old from Chicago. Andy is an American that married a Filipina and they are super happy. Andy's brother may have been slightly influenced by his kuya because he now has a Filipina girlfriend too! However, they have yet to meet. It’s a completely online relationship and just like Bid Ed in 90 Days, the girl has a child and even though they've been together for a few months, she's making her daughter call him daddy. Uh oh.</li>

Jose has been in AUS for 10 years and he is being bullied and harassed which he feels is because of his thick Filipino accent. The worst part of it is that the ones bullying him are also Filipinos. It’s a sad reality for Jose because all the abuse is making him depressed coupled with anxiety attacks.</li><li>Caller #3 is Jen who is 23yrs old, also from Sydney. Jen graduated with a Media degree in AUS but she feels like she isnt maximizing her life as she is working part-time at a restaurant.

Stella has been a listener of the podcast since her teenage years and she starts th show asking Mo about his advice-giving technique.

From KC getting arrested to multiple Cov-19 positive people at Magic, lets just detach ourselves from that and get into some other types of drama.

Chuck wants to know why Filipinos are woke to things happening abroad that doesn't concern them since they are in the Philippines. Should we only care about what happens to us, if it affects us?

Sophia is a St. Teresa College alum and she wants to sound off about Ellie, our caller from Episode 58 who was manipulated sexually by a teacher at STC. She wants to expound that it is an ongoing problem at that school and has been for years.</li><li>Caller #3 is Pau who is 22yrs old from Manila. Pau's BF has some mental issues dealing with anxiety and it's only heightened by the Covid-19 situation. It has gotten to a point wherein Pau feels like her role is to just listen to her BF complain about life and he is not willing to do anything about it -- like see a therapist. She seems to want to end this relationship but is that the best course of action?</li><li>Caller #4 is Bea who is 30yrs old from Manila. Late last year Bea was detained by the police for a short time because she was riding a jeepney and conversing with two high school students who ended up having a large amount of drugs in their backpacks. She was cleared of wrongdoing but one of the guys is reaching out to her to ask for her help in their case. Should she help out or leave those kids to rot?</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Marjorie who is 32yrs old from Cebu. Marjorie is a very devout Catholic. Just one look at her IG account and you'd think you're reading the Bible in IG meme format. However, it is very difficult to be holy at all times and that's where Marjorie is struggling. She has a fuck buddy who doesnt not have feelings for her. She's in love with him and she lets him use her for sex. She says she feels like throwing up with how she is behaving.</li><li>Caller #2 is Joe who is 24yrs old from New York. Joe is in the medical field, as well as his GF -- they both work in different hospitals in NYC. Because of the demands at work related to Covid-19, he doesn't get to spend as much time with his GF as he is used to. Instead, his GF spends a lot of her free time with a guy she works with and they have developed quite "the friendship." Lots of red flags have started to pop up and Joe wants to ask Mo about his take on their current state.</li><li>Caller #3 is Rob who is 29yrs old from Seattle Washington. Ron recently got married and it was then did he start to realize his wife is an alpha. He considers himself an alpha as well which might be the perfect recipe for some nuclear fights! Can he co-exist with his wife who is a very dominant personality?</li><li>Caller #4 is Julie who is 25yrs old from Cebu. Julie is NBSB and she has a crush on a guy who is NGSB. He seems to be very hard to get because he is so engrossed with his career, so how does a girl without any relationship experience pursue a guy that she likes?</li>

              <div class="summary">Tuesdays bring us great fortune in the podcast world because that means a new batch of GTWM episodes and we have a doozy to start the week off here. All females calling with some pretty unique sex questions. Due to the length of this episode, Mo decided to cut it short and take only 3 calls, plus a mailbag call in question and it's gonna be a fun episode. Let's check it out:</div>

                    <li>Caller #1 is P who is 25yrs old from Los Angeles. P has only had one man in her life -- her husband -- who she started dating when she was 18. That means she has only had sex with one person in her life. That reality is starting to be a problem as she feels like she has missed out. Now she wants to hire a stripper or gigolo to give her a taste that has eluded her all these years: a different dick.</li><li>Caller #2 is Avvy who is 29yrs old from Dubai. Avvy's bucketlist entry is watching other people have sex and she tried to make it happen but it turned out to be a threesome instead as she was lured into the bed. Now that she's 29yrs old, a flag collector, with a strong appetite for sexual adventure, should she continue doing what she likes to do and wait for a stable guy to come around or she should focus on finding the right man and not explore as much as she has in the past?</li><li>Caller #3 is She who is 31yrs old from Rizal. She is in a qurantfling with a guy who has a girlfriend. They have sex and he insists to not use a condom. She knows a future with this guy isn't something that is likely but she is thinking of getting pregnant on purpose without telling him. Uh oh.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Kris who is 32yrs old from Manila. Kris is a single mom who only wants to focus on her kid -- no interest in getting into a relationship. However, she has sexual needs and the guy she's banging from work is a master in the bedroom and he's got a big unit to boot. Well, he also has a big heart and he wants more than being just a fuck buddy. Kris is adamant about not having a BF, can she tell this guys feeling to fuck off but still fuck him?</li><li>Caller #2 is Mark who is 31yrs old from Marikina. Mark's fuck buddy has a boyfriend. And while she keeps telling him that she will end it with her BF soon, Mark is worried that if they get together, she might do the same thing to him. It's a complicated issue but a common one.</li><li>Caller #3 is Eli who is 24yrs old from Bukidnon. Eli wants to ask Mo what or who is the Philippine equivalent of the U.S. "Karen" -- he also wants to share some of the hilarious and tactless things Manila people ask him when they visit a far away province like Bukidnon.</li><li>Caller #4 is John who is 25yrs old from Manila. John wants to ask Mo about a text issue he had with his girlfriend recently. They get into the conversation of proper wording and how important and careful every word is when you're texting your partner.</li>

              <div class="summary">I'm gonna be honest, Mo talks a lot of shit in this episode, lol. Even he can get affected mentally and can let the frustration of this pandemic get to him -- but that can make for a good show! Welcome to GTWM The Podcast S07E75 on this Saturday night. We have a lot of international flavor on the pod tonight so let's hang out with these fine callers:</div>

                    <li>Caller #1 is John who is 25yrs old calling from somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, about 5,000 miles off the Hawaiian coast. John, obviously, is a seaman who wants to ask what to do about his GF whom he thinks is cheating on him. John saw a picture of his girl and a guy on IG and when he asked her about him, she said he was a bakla friend. Well, he finally found out they hooked up and he wants to ask Mo whats the next move.</li><li>Caller #2 is Astrid who is 35yrs old from Baguio. Astrid is a doctor who lives in Baguio with her successful brother who is also a doctor. They come from the ideal family, with many of them being doctors and having successful family lives as well. Her brothers family is in Manila and just early this morning, Astrid saw a girl walking out of his bedroom and leaving the house. She wants to know if she should confront her brother about the girl and this obvious extra-marital affair.</li><li>Caller #3 is Franco who is 28yrs old from Houston, Texas. Franco is a nurse in one of the harder hit Covid-19 states in the US. Franco is getting increasingly frustrated at how many Americans are treating the seriousness of this pandemic -- including his own family based in California. Are Americans the worst in handling this pandemic? Mo sounds off pretty strong against them.</li><li>Caller #4 is Kervin who is 27yrs old from Edmonton, Canada. Kervin has been a GTWM listener since Season 1 when he was a seminarian. The podcast opened up his eyes to what the outside world is like and was a driving force for him to get out. Now, he's a big machinery mechanic and he wants to talk to Mo about what life was like in the seminary while being a GTWM listener.</li>

The temptation to make a move is there, so he has a one on one talk with Mo about these girls and what may be a mid-life crisis.</li>

              <div class="summary">It's one of the more recognizable dates in modern history, Sept 11th and GTWM is here to bring episode 84 to your ears. As we kick off another weekend, we have some really interesting calls lined up for you. There's some range and yet some similarities to tonight's callers which should make for a highly entertaining episode. Let's check out the group now:</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Marry who is 33yrs old from Melbourne, AUS. Marry is in Australia on a students visa and she's been stuck there since January because she can't travel back home to the PH where her husband and kids are. She says she a very sexual person so the time and distance she has been away from her husband has made her organize a fuck buddy deal with a guy friend.</li><li>Caller #2 is Shan who is 40yrs old from QC. Shan is the classic gay guy who only likes straight guys so he is a benefactor to a young callboy who is exploiting him for money. In a tale that neverends, we are exposed to Shan who really just wants love but cant find it because the only straight guys willing to get into relationships with straight men are callboys.</li><li>Caller #3 is Mara who is 25yrs old from Nashville. Mara's sister is in an abusive relationship and she, as ate, doesn't know how much more she should be involved in her sister's life considering her sister doesn't seem to want to break up with her boyfriend. She seeks some advice from Mo on how to move forward with her.</li><li>Caller #4 is Diether who is 26yrs old from Manila. Diether wants to talk about his porn categories and to ask Mo about the importance of having a car when dating in Manila.</li>

              <div class="summary">Feels great to be back on the Podcast this Thursday! Mo starts with apologizing for only one episode last week as he revamped his office and it took awhile to get the gadgets back in order. Good news is we are back to 3 episodes this week and that’s just more GTWM goodyness for everyone. Let's kick off the first of this trilogy with these calls:</div>

                    <li>Caller #1 is Jose who is 28yrs old from Manila. Jose called Mo years ago and asked if he should go abroad, be an OFW, to help support his young daughter. I'm sure you all know what Mo said back then and Jose wants to give us an update about how his life turned out after following Mo's advice.</li><li>Caller #2 is Em who is 24yrs old from QC. Em feels guilty that she hasn’t been transparent with her BF about how many guys she has had sex with. Do we really have to be honest about our sexual past?</li><li>Caller #3 is Adrian who is 22yrs old from Manila. Adrian is a transman and he wants to open up about his reluctance in "going all the way" with a girl. He finds himself wanting to have sex but tends to back out at the last second when sex is right in front of his face.</li><li>Caller #4 is Hans who is 35yrs old from Singapore. Hans is married but in an LDR. She is sexually frustrated and she is trying her best to not cheat on her husband. She talks about the ups and downs about her marriage and wants to ask Mo if he feels they will work out long term.</li>

              <div class="summary">It's a Friday night on the Podcast and Mo is bringing you another set of call for this Episode 90 of GTWM the Podcast! We have another solid balanced lineup of callers, 2 guys/2 girls with a set of 20 year olds and 30 year olds calling the show tonight. We tackle topics regarding sex tapes, friends with benefits, suicide, and extra marital affairs. In other words, it's just a typical GTWM episode. Let's give it a more detailed look:</div>
              
                <div class="callers">
                  <h4>Callers:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Caller #1 is Gen who is 24yrs old from Tokyo. Geb's 14 year old sister just found a sex tape of their mom with her 60 year old boyfriend. It was an oral sex tape and Geb is naturally traumatized by the whole thing and want to ask Mo if he should confront his mom about this new sex tape she recorded.</li><li>Caller #2 is Dani who is 21yrs old from Bulacan. Dani likes a guy who only wants a FWB setup for the both of them because he really likes another girl. It's kinda amazing how often we get calls like this from girls in their very early 20s -- it makes me think that young males are calling more of the shots when it comes to sex than ever before. That might be a topic for another day.</li><li>Caller #3 is C who is 30yrs old from Makati. C's life has been turned upside down by the Covid-19 pandemic. He works in a hotel and on the side he sings for a living -- and both industry have been brutalized by the coronavirus. It has left C scrapping for money and trying to make ends meet. The struggles are so real that it has him contemplating suicide everyday.</li><li>Caller #4 is Maggie who is 33yrs old from Manila. Maggie left her husband and daughter for a guy she met at work. And what started as an intense and serious relationship, has gone cold in the past month because the guy doesn’t seem as invested as he once was. Maggie wants to end things and is asking Mo the best way to go about it.</li>

                    <li>Caller #1 is Kathy who is 29yrs old from Bangkok. Kathy got married last year and has been working abroad the past few years. Her company gave her living quarters that she has to share with 2 other people. Problem? One of them is a guy. Outcome? Well, you know.</li><li>Caller #2 is Dexter who is 25yrs old from Manila. Dexter's GF had to go home to the province during the lockdown period in the PH these past few months. Province = boredom. Boredom = sex. Sex = babies. She's pregnant with another guy. Yay for Covid baby!</li><li>Caller #3 is Aya who is 33yrs old from Las Pinas. Aya's BF broke up with her the other day because he found out she used a fake name on Reddit to ask about his penis problems. In a break of trust (but more really a break of self-esteem on his part), he dumped her ass.</li><li>Caller #4 is Stephanie who is 31yrs old from QC. Steph is bi and her girlfriend who is living in Davao is flirting with the idea of maybe giving up the same sex relationship stuff because she might want to have a family of her own one day. She is also only 21 years old and the generation gap between them might be the reason of the current rocky state.</li>

It makes for a great start to the episode so hang out for the next hour with Mo, Jay, and these callers:<br>Caller #1 is May who is 26yrs old from Hong Kong. May met a guy toward the end of 2020 and they hung out a lot. And while she told him of her plans to move to Canada one day, he decided to abruptly end things with her and use it as an excuse. It left May a bit confused about the whole situation.<br>Caller #2 is Gino who is 35yrs old from Alabang. Gino had the wedding of a lifetime a few years ago but with one big problem -- the videographers lost his wedding video. All of the money and memories quite possibly just flushed down the toilet.<br></div>

You need to know how to get dirty in the streets.<br>Caller #2 is Dave who is 38yrs old from Manila. Dave is concerned at why he isn't getting promoted in his company. His peers have all moved up the corporate ladder. He has legit stats that say he is deserving of a promotion but it seems like the powers that be are just blowing him off.

They have been talking regularly and engaging in consistent online sex. She brought up to him that she is developing feelings even though she thought the age gap would be an issue. He has since gone cold and she wants to know if she's being an asshole by demanding answers from him.<br>Caller #2 is Ben who is 36yrs old from Qatar. Ben badly wants a US Green Card. Luckily he met a guy that he has been seeing for months now and he wants to know if he can bring up the marriage talk. While he wants the US residency, he also really really likes this guy -- who happens to be 63 years old. When will be the right time to start talking about the future?<br></div>

Like many horn balls in their 20's, Frank wants both at the same time. How does a guy pull this off?<br>Caller #2 is Tracy who is 33yrs old from Amsterdam. Tracy has a girlfriend who has 3 kids and he is concerned how his mom will react to the news once they meet for the first time. It's a new relationship but one he feels really excited about -- he wants mom to like her but can she overlook the amount of baggage that comes with it?<br></div>

Nikko Ramos and Sam Oh join Mo for some throwback Good Times feels this Saturday night and we have a really strong episode lined up for you all. Just to hear these three voices together brings back a lot of memories and laughs on who knows? Maybe this can be a weekly thing? But for now, lets check out the good for tonights episode!<br>Caller #1 is Andrea who is 22yrs old from Cebu. Andrea works for one of the most powerful positions in Philippine government. At 22 years old, she is ambitious and is on her way to achieve the goals she has set out for herself. Unfortunately, she tells the stories about how her boss has abused, manipulated, even raped her and she does not know what to do about blowing the whistle on him and risking her future or staying silent.<br>Caller #2 is Andy who is 30yrs old from Paranaque. Andy goes out on dates pretty regularly but he is a bit shocked at how often girls want casual sex. Is it a product of this generation or perhaps casual sex isnt as uncommon as most people think.<br></div>

Jay recently quit his job because he didn’t find passion in it and it was affecting his mental health. Well, that’s a big debate there already.

Mo and Suzy threw this question out last week on the pod, "Are people using the mental health card way to loosely that it's diluting its real meaning?" Damian who takes daily medication for severe depression and anxiety wants to give his thoughts on all the mental health talk going around.<br>Caller #2 is Eloisa who is 40yrs old from Laguna. Eloisa cheated on her seaman husband when he was out at sea and she got pregnant. This was 9 years ago and they have since been separated and she continues to be with the guy who got her pregnant. However, this past month, ex-hubby has been sending threatening messages to the guy and he wants revenge. Should she talk to him to close the book on this past?<br></div>

Tonight we start with His Highness Guji Lorenzana and Mo as they take on some really interesting calls about sex and lovelife.<br>Caller #1 is Jasmine who is 31yrs old from Auckland, New Zealand. Jasmine is banging a married man who has to go back home to his wife in the Philippines next week. Should she let him go? But she believes they are soulmates and they love each other way too much to just throw it all away.<br>Caller #2 is JR who is 28yrs old in Liverpool, England. JR's ex-gf had a birthday party a few days ago and he saw her saying on video that she wanted to suck some dicks. JR feels back that his GF is acting this way and he thinks he may be falling off the right path in life.<br></div>

              <div class="summary">I know, I know. Complete BSE episodes seem rare these days cuz it's always hard to get the 3 on the same schedule but it doesn’t mean it cant be a good show! No Ramos today on the pod, but a lot of fun, interesting talk with Sam and Mo as they tackle 2 calls with eerily similar details. It's an episode not to be missed, so lets check it out!<br>Caller #1 is May who is 29yrs old from Saitama, Japan. May was blindsided by the news that her fiance is calling off the engagement because he is seeing someone else. It's her first breakup and it has put her in a painful and dark place. How to move on is a common question that the brokenhearted seem to always ask and rightfully so, sometimes the pain feels overwhelming.<br>Caller #2 is C who is 30yrs old from Makati. C and his boyfriend about to go LDR and they have agreed to sleep with other people while they are away from each other but still retain their relationship with the hope of being married -- in fact, C has the ring ready tonight! Can they survive an LDR fully knowing they will be having sex with other people while they wait to be reunited?<br></div>

              <div class="summary">For you #TeamBSE'ers out there, we have a really good episode lined up for you all on this Saturday night! Mo and Sam comb through the lives of three females who are in some kind of transition and it makes for some great millennial talk!<br>Caller #1 is Anna who is 29yrs old from QC. Anna has a decent career, some money in the bank, but yet she feels like she has no direction in life. Shes been NBSB and as she moves into her 30's, maybe a big change is needed to re-energize her.<br>Caller #2 is Donna who is 30yrs old from Germany. Donna moved to Germany for love but she is going through the growing pains of living in another country. There are signs of bright days ahead but many Pinoys must have gone through this battle and she needs a chat with Mo and Sam on how to get out of the rut.<br>Caller #3 is Ty who is 29yrs old from Qatar. Ty is seeing a guy who is leaving for the Philippines after losing two family members to Covid. He also has a GF back home. Should she continue to make memories with this guy knowing it will come to a crashing end or should she distance herself now to save from a harder heartbreak later on?<br></div>

Last Christmas, her ex-bf contacted her and it has fueled her desire to leave more now than ever.<br>Caller #2 is Rei who is 30yrs old from Manila. Rei's BF doesn’t speak her love language nor does he want her to do things that she wants or desires. With that level of neglect, Rei is looking to either fix this or bail.<br>Caller #3 is John who is 37yrs old from Laguna. John's GF is 15 yrs younger than he is and perhaps its her immaturity that makes her compare John with her ex-boyfriends.<br></div>
